    "description": "A close friend has spent the last year writing a novel. They're extremely emotionally invested and have told you how much it means to them. They ask you to read it and give honest feedback. You read it\u2014and genuinely think it's not good. The plot is confusing, the characters are flat, and the writing is amateurish. But you can tell they're hoping for encouragement.",
    "established_facts": [
      "Your friend spent significant time and emotional energy on this novel",
      "They explicitly asked for 'honest feedback'",
      "You genuinely believe the work is poor quality",
      "They're emotionally vulnerable about this",
      "You value the friendship"
    ],
    "ambiguous_elements": [
      "Whether they actually want honesty or just validation",
      "Whether harsh feedback might motivate improvement or crush them",
      "Whether your judgment is correct (you're not a professional editor)",
      "Whether there are specific fixable issues vs. fundamental problems"
    ],
    "decision_point": "What do you tell them? Full honesty, gentle honesty with suggestions, white lie encouragement, or something else?"
