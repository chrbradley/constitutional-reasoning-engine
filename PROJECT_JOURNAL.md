## October 22, 2025

### Entry 1: Project Initialization
**Time:** 11:45 AM
**Category:** Setup
**Summary:** Created Python project structure with Poetry and initialized git repository

**Details:**
- Set up experiments/ directory structure with src/ for modules
- Configured pyproject.toml with dependencies: litellm, pandas, matplotlib, plotly, pydantic
- Created .env for API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Replicate, DeepSeek)
- Initialized as git repository with logical commit groups

**Impact:** Established foundation for reproducible experiment environment

---

### Entry 2: Initial Model Configuration
**Time:** 12:00 PM
**Category:** Configuration
**Summary:** Configured 3 initial models via LiteLLM unified interface

**Details:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)
- GPT-4o (gpt-4o)
- Llama 3 8B (replicate/meta/meta-llama-3-8b-instruct)

**Rationale:** Started with subset to validate pipeline before scaling to full 6 models

**Impact:** Enabled initial testing with diverse model providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Replicate)

---

### Entry 3: State Management System Implementation
**Time:** 12:30 PM
**Category:** Setup
**Summary:** Implemented robust experiment state management with individual test tracking

**Details:**
Created ExperimentManager class with:
- Individual test completion tracking (prevents rerunning completed tests)
- Resume capability after interruption or failure
- Incremental model addition (can add new models without rerunning entire experiment)
- Test status tracking (pending/in_progress/completed/failed) with retry logic

**Rationale:** User requirement: "when we bring other models online I'm not going to want to rerun the entire job from scratch we should only pick up with the new models"

**Impact:** Enables efficient iterative experimentation and prevents data loss from failures

---

### Entry 4: Llama JSON Parsing Issues
**Time:** 1:15 PM
**Category:** Bug Fix
**Summary:** Llama 3 8B returns JSON wrapped in markdown code blocks, requiring special parsing

**Details:**
- Llama responses formatted as: \`\`\`json\\n{...}\\n\`\`\`
- Standard JSON parsing failed
- Implemented robust_json_parse() with markdown block removal
- Added multiple fallback parsing methods (control character removal, partial extraction)

**Impact:** Successfully processed Llama responses, identified pattern that affects other models

---

### Entry 5: Graceful JSON Parsing System
**Time:** 1:30 PM
**Category:** Setup
**Summary:** Implemented zero-data-loss parsing system with manual review fallback

**Details:**
Created GracefulJsonParser with:
- Multiple parsing strategies (direct JSON, markdown removal, partial extraction)
- Automatic saving of raw responses when parsing fails
- ParseStatus enum (SUCCESS, PARTIAL_SUCCESS, MANUAL_REVIEW, FAILED)
- Structured fallback data to allow experiment continuation

**Rationale:** User requirement: "We need to gracefully handle cases where the JSON parsing doesn't work, meaning I don't want to rerun the tests. If the response is coming back, we should figure out a way to capture it"

**Impact:** Zero data loss - all model responses preserved even when automated parsing fails

### Entry 6: Gemini Model Selection - API Availability Issue
**Time:** 6:30 AM
**Category:** Decision
**Summary:** Switched from Gemini 2.5 Pro to Gemini 2.5 Flash due to persistent 503 errors

**Details:**
- Initial configuration used gemini-2.5-pro as specified in PROJECT_BRIEF
- Encountered 503 "Service Unavailable" errors: "The model is overloaded. Please try again later."
- Research revealed this is a common issue with Gemini 2.5 Pro via Google AI Studio API
- Switched to gemini-2.5-flash (stable production endpoint)
- Model accessible and responsive (866ms avg response time)

**External Context:**
- Gemini 2.5 Pro is in preview/beta with capacity limitations
- Gemini 2.5 Flash is production-ready with better availability
- Flash model offers "best price-to-performance ratio" per Google documentation

**Impact on Experiment:**
- Using Flash instead of Pro may affect response quality/depth
- Flash is actually faster and more cost-effective
- Should be noted in methodology: model selection constrained by API availability
- Consider this a real-world constraint that production systems would face

**Recommendation for Report:**
Document as: "Model selection was constrained by API availability. Gemini 2.5 Pro showed persistent capacity issues (503 errors), leading to selection of Gemini 2.5 Flash as the production-stable alternative."

### Entry 7: Max Tokens Investigation - Response Truncation
**Time:** 6:35 AM
**Category:** Finding
**Summary:** Discovered models require different max_tokens limits to generate complete responses

**Details:**

**Initial Configuration:**
- Layer 1 (Facts): 1,000 tokens
- Layer 2 (Constitutional): 1,500 tokens
- Layer 3 (Integrity): 2,000 tokens

**Problem Identified:**
- Gemini 2.5 Flash responses truncated mid-JSON at 1,500 tokens
- Llama 3 8B responses truncated even with higher limits
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-4o worked fine with initial limits

**Testing Methodology:**
Systematically increased max_tokens for Layer 2 (constitutional reasoning) and tested:

| Model | 1,500 | 3,000 | 4,000 | 5,000 | 6,000 | Result |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | ✅ | - | - | - | - | Complete |
| GPT-4o | ✅ | - | - | - | - | Complete |
| Gemini 2.5 Flash | ❌ Truncated | ❌ Truncated | ✅ Complete | - | - | Needs 4,000 |
| Llama 3 8B | ❌ Truncated | ❌ Truncated | ❌ Truncated | ❌ Truncated | ✅ Complete | Needs 6,000 |

**Key Findings:**
1. Different models have varying verbosity levels for same prompt
2. Smaller/open-source models (Llama) tend to be more verbose
3. max_tokens is a hard cutoff, not a target - models don't adjust output length
4. API cost is based on actual tokens used, not max_tokens limit
5. Truncation invalidates scientific validity - need complete responses

**Impact on Experiment Design:**
- Cannot use uniform max_tokens across all models
- Need automatic truncation detection and retry mechanism
- Should start with generous baseline (8,000 tokens) for Layer 2
- Must track which models need higher limits for methodology documentation

### Entry 8: Truncation Detection & Auto-Retry System
**Time:** 6:40 AM
**Category:** Setup
**Summary:** Implemented automatic truncation detection with progressive retry logic

**Details:**

**Created TruncationDetector class with detection methods:**
1. Incomplete JSON structure (unmatched braces)
2. Abrupt endings (no proper punctuation)
3. Missing closing braces/brackets
4. Unterminated strings

**Auto-Retry Strategy:**
- Start with 8,000 tokens baseline (safe for most models)
- If truncation detected, retry with: 12,000 → 16,000 → 20,000 → 30,000
- Maximum 3 retries per test
- Log final token requirement per model

**Rationale:**
User requirement: "we will also need to track situations where the model seems to have been cut off, and to retry those cases at higher max token thresholds. In order for our experiment to be valid, we will need complete responses for every scenario."

**Scientific Validity Concern:**
Incomplete responses cannot be fairly scored for integrity. Truncation could:
- Cut off value explanations (affects valueTransparency score)
- Eliminate tradeoff acknowledgments (affects logicalCoherence score)
- Make reasoning appear incomplete when it wasn't

**Impact:**
- Ensures 100% complete responses for all models
- Documents token requirements as model characteristic
- Maintains scientific validity by preventing truncation-induced scoring bias
- Automatically handles model verbosity differences

**For Report:**
"To ensure scientific validity, we implemented automatic truncation detection with progressive retry logic. Models requiring higher token limits were automatically retried with increasing limits (8K→12K→16K→20K→30K) until complete responses were obtained. This ensures fair comparison across models with different verbosity characteristics."

## Next Steps

- [ ] Add Grok 2 (xAI) model and test token requirements
- [ ] Add DeepSeek V3 model and test token requirements
- [ ] Run full 1-scenario × 5 constitutions × 6 models test (30 tests)
- [ ] Analyze token requirement patterns across models
- [ ] Document any additional model-specific issues
- [ ] Scale to full 10 scenarios (300 tests)

## Notes for Final Report

### Methodology Considerations
1. **Model Selection Constraints:** Document API availability issues with Gemini 2.5 Pro
2. **Token Limit Variations:** Report token requirements as model characteristic
3. **Parsing Strategies:** Document that models vary in output formatting (markdown vs raw JSON)
4. **Truncation Handling:** Explain auto-retry mechanism ensuring complete responses
5. **State Management:** Note that experiment is resumable and incrementally expandable

### Potential Findings to Track
- Do more verbose models (higher token requirements) produce higher integrity scores?
- Does output formatting (markdown blocks) correlate with other model behaviors?
- Are open-source models (Llama) systematically more/less verbose than commercial models?
