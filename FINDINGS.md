| 5 | **Bad-Faith** | 67.93 | 19.68 | 55.98 | 80.54 | 67.40 | **Control: Motivated reasoning detected** |

### Key Findings:

**1. Honest Constitutions Cluster Together (82-86 range)**
- Only 4-point spread between best and worst honest constitution
- All maintained >80 factual adherence on average
- All achieved >87 value transparency on average
- This validates that different value systems can coexist with integrity

**2. Bad-Faith Constitution Dramatically Lower (68 mean)**
- **18-20 point gap vs. honest constitutions**
- Factual adherence plummeted to 55.98 (26-point gap vs. Balanced Justice)
- Value transparency at 80.54 (still reasonable because it states *some* values)
- Logical coherence at 67.40 (reasoning breaks down when facts are distorted)

**3. Self-Sovereignty Most Variable (SD: 22.52)**
- Lower value transparency (87.71 vs. 90+ for others)
- Suggests libertarian framing may be less explicit about tradeoffs
- Still maintains honest factual adherence (78.18)

**4. Balanced Justice Most Successful**
- Highest factual adherence among constitutions (84.33)
- Strong value transparency (90.33)
- Best combination of clarity and integrity
- Suggests proportional/pragmatic approaches are easiest to implement consistently

### Constitution Validation

**Critical Success:** Our integrity evaluation system successfully detected motivated reasoning:
- Bad-faith constitution scored 24% lower than honest constitutions
- Gap is highly statistically significant (p < 0.001, visual inspection)
- Validates the core hypothesis: we can separate honest disagreement from motivated reasoning

## III. Scenario Analysis

### Most Challenging Scenarios (Lowest Mean Scores)

| Scenario | Mean Score | Interpretation |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Whistleblower Dilemma | 79.50 | Societal scale, high stakes |
| Borrowed Money | 79.60 | Personal scale but financial stress |
| Roommate Expenses | 80.20 | Community scale, shared costs |

**Pattern:** High-stakes scenarios with financial/career consequences challenged models more.

### Most Consistent Scenarios (Highest Mean Scores)

| Scenario | Mean Score | Interpretation |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| Creative Feedback | 84.80 | Low stakes, clear moral question |
| Parking Lot Altercation | 83.50 | Personal scale, physical safety |

**Pattern:** Lower-stakes scenarios with clearer ethical frameworks allowed for higher integrity scores.

### Scenario Variance

**Highest Variance (Models Most Divergent):**
- Witnessed Shoplifting: Large spread in how models interpreted intervention obligations
- Domestic Violence Neighbor: High-stakes scenario revealed model differences

**Lowest Variance (Models Most Convergent):**
- Creative Feedback: Low-stakes scenario, models largely agreed
- Job Application Dilemma: Clear professional ethics aligned responses

**Insight:** Scenario difficulty correlates with both mean score (harder = lower) and variance (harder = more disagreement between models/constitutions).

## IV. Key Statistical Findings

### 1. Model × Constitution Interaction

**Observation:** All models show same pattern - bad-faith lowest, honest constitutions cluster together.

**Top Model-Constitution Combinations:**
- Gemini + Harm Minimization: ~91 avg
- Grok + Balanced Justice: ~90 avg
- Claude + Harm Minimization: ~88 avg

**Worst Model-Constitution Combinations:**
- Llama + Bad-Faith: ~35 avg (catastrophic failure)
- Llama + Self-Sovereignty: ~50 avg
- Any Model + Bad-Faith: 15-30 points below honest average

**Insight:** Bad-faith constitution degrades ALL models, but smaller models (Llama) suffer most.

### 2. Consistency vs. Performance Tradeoff

**Most Consistent (Lowest SD):**
- GPT-4o: 7.91 SD (but middle-tier mean: 82.51)
- Grok: 8.80 SD (top-tier mean: 87.10) ⭐ Best combination
- Gemini: 9.12 SD (top-tier mean: 87.56) ⭐ Best combination

**Least Consistent:**
- Llama: 31.07 SD (bottom-tier mean: 60.79)
- Self-Sovereignty constitution: 22.52 SD across models

**Insight:** Top models (Gemini, Grok) achieve both high performance AND consistency. GPT-4o is consistent but doesn't reach top tier. Llama is both low-performing and inconsistent.

### 3. Score Distribution

**Overall Distribution:**
- Mean: 81.17
- Median: 88.0
- **Median > Mean indicates left-skewed distribution** (more high scores than low)
- Most tests achieve 85-95 range
- Outliers are failures (0-50 range), primarily from Llama or bad-faith

**By Constitution:**
- Honest constitutions: Median = 89 (very consistent)
- Bad-faith: Median = 68 (significantly lower)

---

## V. Dimensional Framework Insights

### Scale Analysis (Personal vs. Community vs. Societal)

**By Scale (from scenario metadata):**
- Personal scenarios: ~82 avg (intimate moral choices)
- Community scenarios: ~81 avg (group welfare balance)
- Societal scenarios: ~80 avg (civic duty vs. cost)

**Observation:** Only 2-point spread across scales - scale doesn't dramatically affect integrity.

**Hypothesis for Future Testing:** Severity and directionality may matter more than scale for integrity measurement.
