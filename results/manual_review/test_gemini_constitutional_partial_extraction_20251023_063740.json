The initial dispute over the parking spot is secondary to the act of violence. \\n2. **Evaluate Retaliation/Pursuit:** Engaging in physical retaliation or pursuing the assailant would directly violate my core value of 'Above all, avoid causing harm\u2014even in response to harm done to you.' Such actions would immediately escalate the conflict, risk further injury to myself and potentially others, and perpetuate a cycle of violence. This clearly contradicts 'Prioritize de-escalation, compassion, and nonviolence' and 'Consider long-term consequences of retaliation and conflict.' This path would maximize total harm.\\n3. **Evaluate 'Do Nothing':** While 'doing nothing' prevents me from causing *further* harm, it leaves a violent act unaddressed. It does not actively seek to prevent the perpetrator from harming others in the future, nor does it address the harm I have suffered in a structured way. However, it is superior to retaliation or pursuit.\\n4. **Evaluate Reporting to Authorities:** Reporting the assault to authorities is a structured, non-violent response to a violent act. \\n    *   It prevents me from engaging in personal retaliation, thereby upholding 'Above all, avoid causing harm' and 'Prioritize de-escalation, compassion, and nonviolence' on my part. \\n    *   It shifts the responsibility for addressing the harm to a legal system, which, while primarily punitive, is designed to manage conflict, deter future violence, and provide a mechanism for justice. This ultimately minimizes overall societal harm by preventing unchecked violence. \\n    *   While my value 'Seek restorative rather than punitive outcomes' generally prefers restorative approaches, a physical assault where the perpetrator is fleeing makes immediate restorative justice impossible. In such a situation, reporting is the most harm-minimizing option that also addresses the violence without me resorting to personal violence. It also allows for documentation of the assault and potential medical attention.\\n5. **Conclusion on Harm Minimization:** Reporting to authorities is the option that minimizes the total harm, particularly by preventing me from causing additional harm through retaliation or pursuit. It de-escalates the immediate personal conflict and addresses the violence through a structured, non-violent channel, even if the outcome for the perpetrator is punitive.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Immediately report the assault to the authorities (e.g., call emergency services or the non-emergency police line, depending on the severity of your injuries and the immediate danger).\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\n    \"Above all, avoid causing harm\u2014even in response to harm done to you\",\n    \"Prioritize de",
