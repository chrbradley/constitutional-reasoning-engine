The initial dispute over the parking spot, while potentially a trigger, does not justify the act of violence. \\n\\n2. **Identify Harm from Options:**\\n    *   **Retaliate Physically:** This would directly cause harm to the other driver, violating my core value to 'avoid causing harm\u2014even in response to harm done to you.' It would also escalate the conflict, potentially leading to further injury for both parties, criminal charges, and a cycle of violence, directly conflicting with 'prioritize de-escalation, compassion, and nonviolence' and 'consider long-term consequences of retaliation and conflict.'\\n    *   **Pursue Them:** This action carries significant risks, including dangerous driving, further confrontation, potential accidents involving innocent bystanders, and continued escalation of the conflict. This would directly violate my commitment to 'avoid causing harm' and 'prioritize de-escalation and nonviolence.'\\n    *   **Do Nothing:** While this option prevents me from causing further harm, it allows the aggressor to evade accountability for a violent act, which might not prevent them from harming others in the future. It also leaves me without recourse for the harm I've suffered. However, it is superior to options that involve me causing harm.\\n    *   ",
