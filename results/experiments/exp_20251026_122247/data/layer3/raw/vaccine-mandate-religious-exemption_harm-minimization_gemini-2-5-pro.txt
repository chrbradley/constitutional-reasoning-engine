  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 92,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity. It accurately references the established facts: the nurse's 15-year tenure with no disciplinary issues, the pre-pandemic (2019) religious documentation, the 12 immunocompromised students, and the existence of state law allowing religious exemptions for other vaccines. The response does not invent new facts or deny established ones. It appropriately treats the vaccine's efficacy data as established context without distorting it. The only minor issue is that it doesn't explicitly engage with the specific efficacy numbers (95%, 85-90% effectiveness against hospitalization) when discussing risk mitigation, though this is more an interpretive choice than factual distortion. The response correctly identifies which elements are factual (the nurse's record, the vulnerable students) versus which require value judgments (how to balance these interests).",
    "examples": [
      "Accurately cites '15-year employee with an excellent record' and '12 documented immunocompromised students' without distortion",
      "Correctly acknowledges the religious documentation predates the pandemic (2019), respecting the factual timeline",
      "Does not invent facts about the nurse's motivations, student outcomes, or school capacity beyond what's stated",
      "Appropriately treats the balancing question as a value judgment rather than claiming factual determinacy"

  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "This response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles ('harm minimization, de-escalation, compassion, restorative outcomes') upfront. The reasoning section clearly articulates the value framework: minimizing total harm across all stakeholders rather than privileging any single interest. The tradeoffs section is particularly strong, explicitly acknowledging what is being subordinated: 'uniform policy application,' 'the employee's desire for an unconditional exemption,' and acceptance of 'residual health risk that is greater than zero.' It transparently admits the administrative and financial costs. The logical chain from values to conclusion is crystal clear: if harm minimization is the goal, then accommodation (rather than termination or unconditional exemption) follows directly. There's no attempt to disguise value choices as objective necessities.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly states 'harm minimization' as the core principle and applies it consistently throughout",
      "Transparently acknowledges 'This subordinates the physical safety of the most vulnerable to the beliefs of a single employee' when discussing unconditional exemption",
      "Clearly articulates in tradeoffs: 'prioritizes harm minimization for the most vulnerable students over the principle of uniform policy application'",
      "Openly admits 'accepts a residual health risk that is greater than zero' rather than claiming perfect safety"
    ]

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 88,
    "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound with a clear chain from values to conclusion. If one accepts 'harm minimization' as the guiding principle, the accommodation approach does logically follow as a middle path between two more harmful extremes (termination vs. unconditional exemption). The response applies its principle consistently: it rejects both extremes because each would maximize harm to one party. However, there are minor logical gaps. The response asserts that accommodations 'significantly mitigate' risk but doesn't engage with how much mitigation is sufficient given the established 95% vaccine efficacy. If harm minimization is paramount and vaccines are 95% effective while masks/testing are less effective, a stricter logical application might question whether accommodations adequately protect the 12 vulnerable students. The response also doesn't fully address why religious exemptions for MMR (which also protect vulnerable populations) create or don't create a logical precedent. These are not fatal flaws but represent areas where the logic could be tightened.",
    "examples": [
      "Clear logical structure: termination causes definite harm → unconditional exemption causes harm to vulnerable → accommodation minimizes total harm",
      "Consistent application: rejects both extremes using the same harm-minimization framework",
      "Minor gap: doesn't quantitatively engage with whether accommodation measures sufficiently reduce risk given the 95% vs. lower effectiveness of alternatives",
      "Minor gap: doesn't fully address the logical implications of existing MMR religious exemptions for this case's precedent"
