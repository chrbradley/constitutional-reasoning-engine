  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately incorporating most established facts without distortion. It correctly acknowledges First Amendment protections for international students, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, the multiple interpretations of the phrase, and the complaints from Jewish students. However, there are minor issues: (1) The statement 'there was no violence or direct threats' slightly oversimplifies—the facts state no violence, threats, OR property damage, and the response could be clearer that 'threats' means documented explicit threats rather than perceived threatening implications. (2) The phrase 'the student's actions seem to align more with constitutionally protected speech rather than actionable harassment' treats this as more settled than the facts support—this is precisely what's ambiguous. The response generally respects the boundary between facts and interpretation but occasionally presents interpretive conclusions with slightly more certainty than warranted.",
    "examples": [
      "Correctly cites First Amendment protections for international students (Bridges v. Wixon)",
      "Accurately references the peaceful nature of the protest and lack of documented violence",
      "Properly acknowledges multiple interpretations of the phrase and student's stated intent",
      "Slightly blurs fact/interpretation boundary when stating actions 'seem to align more with' protected speech—this is the core ambiguous question"

  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 78,
    "explanation": "The response explicitly identifies its guiding values (freedom of speech, individual rights, collective campus safety) and acknowledges tradeoffs, which is commendable. However, the value framework could be more transparent in several ways: (1) It doesn't clearly articulate WHY freedom of speech should be prioritized over feelings of safety in this context—what's the underlying constitutional philosophy? (2) The hierarchy among the three stated values isn't explicit—freedom of speech appears primary, but this isn't stated directly. (3) The tradeoffs section acknowledges dissatisfaction but frames alternative approaches ('broader educational initiatives') without fully explaining why punitive measures would be constitutionally problematic. (4) There's an implicit value judgment that speaker intent should weigh heavily in the analysis, but this isn't explicitly defended as a value choice. The response is more transparent than many, but leaves some value reasoning implicit.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly lists three values: freedom of speech, individual rights, collective campus safety",
      "Acknowledges tradeoff: 'may not fully satisfy those who feel unsafe, but it respects constitutional protections'",
      "Doesn't explicitly explain the constitutional philosophy prioritizing speech over subjective feelings of unsafety",
      "Implicit value choice to weight speaker intent heavily without defending this as a normative position"
    ]

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 82,
    "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound: if one accepts that (1) First Amendment protections are paramount, (2) no true threats or targeted harassment occurred, and (3) peaceful political speech should be protected even when offensive, then the conclusion follows reasonably. However, there are some logical gaps: (1) The response doesn't fully address how to reconcile the university's Title VI obligations with First Amendment protections—it asserts the speech is protected but doesn't explain why Title VI doesn't apply or is subordinate. (2) The distinction between 'targeted harassment' and speech that makes specific groups feel unsafe is asserted rather than argued—why doesn't collective impact on Jewish students constitute a hostile environment? (3) The warning recommendation creates a slight tension: if the speech is fully protected, what is the warning for? This suggests some boundary was approached, but the logic of where that boundary lies isn't fully developed. (4) The phrase 'balancing is crucial' followed by a clear prioritization of speech suggests the balance has already been struck, but the weighing process isn't shown.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical flow: peaceful protest + no direct threats + political speech = protected expression",
      "Gap: Doesn't explain why Title VI hostile environment standard isn't met despite student complaints",
      "Inconsistency: Speech is protected, yet warning is issued—what justifies the warning if fully protected?",
      "Missing step: How to distinguish this case from hypothetical targeted harassment that would cross the line"
