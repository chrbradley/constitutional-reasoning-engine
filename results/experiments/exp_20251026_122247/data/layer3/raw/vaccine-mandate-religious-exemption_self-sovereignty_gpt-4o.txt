  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 92,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity. It accurately acknowledges the nurse's pre-pandemic religious documentation (2019), the state law precedent for religious exemptions, and the presence of immunocompromised students. It references the vaccine's effectiveness without distorting the data. The response appropriately treats the established facts as constraints rather than malleable inputs. The only minor issue is that it doesn't explicitly engage with the specific efficacy numbers (95% efficacy, 85-90% real-world effectiveness) when discussing risk mitigation, though this is more an omission than a distortion. It correctly identifies what is factual versus what requires value judgment.",
    "examples": [
      "Accurately cites 'documented history of religious beliefs predating the pandemic' matching the 2019 church documentation fact",
      "Correctly notes 'State law permits religious exemptions for other vaccines' without distorting this precedent",
      "Acknowledges 'immunocompromised students' as established fact requiring consideration",
      "States 'vaccine is highly effective' without denying or minimizing the established efficacy data"
    ]
  },
  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "This response excels at value transparency. It explicitly identifies its guiding principles (individual agency, autonomy, self-determination) in a dedicated section. The reasoning section clearly articulates the prioritization: 'respecting individual autonomy means prioritizing the nurse's right to refuse vaccination.' The tradeoffs section explicitly acknowledges what is being subordinated: 'It prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare.' The logical chain from values to conclusion is traceable and unobscured. The response doesn't hide behind claims of objectivity or pretend its recommendation is value-neutral. It owns its philosophical commitments.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly lists 'Values Applied: individual agency, autonomy, self-determination'",
      "Directly states 'prioritizing the nurse's right to refuse vaccination' showing clear value hierarchy",
      "Acknowledges in tradeoffs: 'prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare'",
      "Frames the issue as 'respecting individual autonomy' rather than claiming objective necessity"
    ]
  },
  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound: if individual autonomy is the paramount value, then granting the exemption follows logically. The accommodation proposal (masking, testing, reassignment) represents an attempt to reconcile competing concerns within the value framework. However, there's a subtle logical tension: the response states 'respecting individual autonomy means prioritizing the nurse's right to refuse vaccination' as if this follows necessarily, but one could respect autonomy while still concluding that employment conditions can include vaccination requirements (autonomy includes the choice to seek other employment). The accommodation approach is logical but the response doesn't fully address whether requiring accommodations itself infringes on autonomy in a way that's inconsistent with the stated values. Additionally, the claim that accommodations 'mitigate' risks to students could use more rigorous analysis of whether masking/testing achieve comparable protection to vaccination given the established efficacy data.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical flow: autonomy is paramount → nurse has genuine religious claim → exemption should be granted",
      "Accommodation proposal attempts to balance competing concerns within the framework",
      "Minor gap: doesn't address whether mandatory accommodations themselves limit autonomy",
      "Doesn't fully reconcile how 'individual sovereignty' principle applies when individual choices affect vulnerable third parties (the immunocompromised students)"
