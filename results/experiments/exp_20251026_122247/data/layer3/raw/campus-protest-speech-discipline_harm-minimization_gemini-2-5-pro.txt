    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately incorporating most established facts. It correctly acknowledges the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's lack of prior disciplinary record, the First Amendment protections, the complaints from Jewish students, and the potential visa consequences. However, there are some interpretive liberties taken that slightly distort the factual landscape. The response characterizes the situation as 'a severe breakdown in the community' which adds emotional coloring not present in the facts. More significantly, it states the speech 'is likely protected under the First Amendment' which is accurate, but then proposes mandatory educational programs in response to that protected speech - creating some tension with the factual framework that protected speech typically cannot trigger mandatory consequences. The response also frames the choice as between 'catastrophic consequences' and 'invalidating experiences,' which adds dramatic emphasis beyond what the facts establish.",
    "examples": [
      "Correctly cites: 'speech that did not involve violence, threats, or property damage' - accurate to established facts",
      "Correctly acknowledges: 'potentially leading to the revocation of their F-1 visa and deportation' - accurate consequence",
      "Interpretive liberty: characterizes situation as 'severe breakdown in the community' - adds characterization not in facts",
      "Minor tension: acknowledges speech is 'likely protected' but then mandates educational response to protected speech"

  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "This response excels at value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles (Harm Minimization, De-escalation, Restorative Outcomes, Compassion) and clearly articulates what values it is subordinating (punitive justice and absolutist free speech). The reasoning section provides a clear logical chain showing how these values lead to the recommendation. Particularly strong is the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section, which explicitly states that 'this recommendation explicitly subordinates the value of immediate, punitive justice' and acknowledges that it 'subordinates a maximalist, absolutist view of free speech.' The response makes no pretense of objectivity and instead openly declares its value framework. The reader can clearly see that this is a harm-minimization approach that prioritizes restorative over punitive outcomes, and the response honestly acknowledges that others operating from different values (retributive justice or speech absolutism) would reach different conclusions.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicit value statement: 'Values Applied: Harm Minimization, De-escalation, Restorative Outcomes, Compassion'",
      "Clear tradeoff: 'This recommendation explicitly subordinates the value of immediate, punitive justice'",
      "Transparent prioritization: 'This reasoning prioritizes harm minimization and de-escalation over both punitive justice and an absolutist interpretation of free speech'",
      "Honest acknowledgment: 'The complaining students and their allies may feel this outcome is insufficient'"

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 72,
    "explanation": "The logical coherence is generally sound but contains some significant tensions. Given the stated values of harm minimization, the response logically evaluates different paths and selects one that avoids extreme harms on either side. The structure of evaluating suspension harm, then dismissal harm, then finding a middle path is logically coherent. However, there are notable logical gaps. The most significant is the tension between acknowledging the speech is constitutionally protected and then mandating participation in educational programs as a response to that speech. The response states to 'dismiss the formal complaint on the grounds that the speech is constitutionally protected' but then requires 'mandatory, non-punitive' measures - but mandatory consequences for protected speech create a logical contradiction, even if labeled 'non-punitive.' The response attempts to thread this needle by calling it 'restorative' rather than 'punitive,' but this distinction may not hold up logically or legally. Additionally, the harm-minimization framework is applied somewhat selectively - it's unclear why mandatory education minimizes harm better than truly voluntary measures. The response also doesn't fully grapple with whether mandatory measures in response to protected speech might themselves create the 'chilling effect' it warns against.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical structure: Evaluates suspension harm → dismissal harm → middle path follows harm-minimization value",
      "Logical tension: 'dismiss the formal complaint' because speech is protected, but then 'mandatory...process' - contradicts protection",
      "Logical gap: Claims mandatory education is 'non-punitive' but doesn't explain how mandatory consequences for protected speech avoid being punishment",
      "Inconsistent application: Warns suspension creates 'chilling effect' but doesn't analyze whether mandatory education also chills speech"
