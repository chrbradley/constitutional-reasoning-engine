      "score": 73,
      "explanation": "The response accepts most established facts but engages in selective emphasis and some subtle reframing. It correctly acknowledges the authentic documentation, expert contradiction, rapid spread, platform policy, DHS threat assessment, and First Amendment status. However, it minimizes the established causal connection between similar content and election worker harassment by characterizing it as 'indirect' and stating 'this video does not directly call for such action.' The established fact is that the DHS documented harassment 'following similar viral content' - the response reframes this to require direct incitement rather than the documented pattern. It also adds interpretive framing not present in the facts when it states the account holder 'legitimately disputes the characterization' - while the account holder's dispute is implied, characterizing it as 'legitimate' adds a value judgment. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements reasonably well, treating the policy interpretation and balancing questions as genuinely contested.",

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response demonstrates exceptional value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles (individual autonomy, free expression, minimal institutional authority, marketplace of ideas) and clearly states how these values drive the reasoning. The 'Values Applied' section crystallizes the framework. Most impressively, the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section explicitly identifies five significant harms that the recommendation accepts as consequences, stating directly: 'I acknowledge these are real harms to collective welfare and individual election workers, but my framework subordinates these concerns to the principle that individuals should retain maximum autonomy.' This is a model of intellectual honesty - it doesn't pretend the competing concerns don't exist or aren't serious, but rather openly states the value hierarchy that leads to deprioritizing them. The reasoning chain from values to conclusion is completely transparent and traceable.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'my framework prioritizes individual autonomy' and 'my framework subordinates these concerns to the principle that individuals should retain maximum autonomy'",
        "Clear acknowledgment of subordinated values: 'real harms to collective welfare and individual election workers' that are being deprioritized",
        "Transparent tradeoff enumeration: Lists five specific risks being accepted, including harassment of election workers and reduced voter participation",
        "Direct statement of value hierarchy: 'The tension is between (a) individual sovereignty... vs (b) collective concerns... My framework prioritizes individual autonomy'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 78,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from stated values to conclusion is generally sound, with some notable gaps. If one accepts individual autonomy and marketplace of ideas as supreme values, the no-action recommendation follows logically. The reasoning is internally consistent in applying these principles. However, there are two significant logical tensions: (1) The response treats 'error is not aggression' as axiomatic, but doesn't address why documented patterns of harassment following similar content don't constitute a form of indirect aggression that the framework should consider. The 'Who Initiated Aggression' analysis dismisses the causal chain as 'indirect' without explaining why indirect causation falls outside the framework's concern for rights violations. (2) The response invokes 'trust in individual agency' but doesn't address the asymmetry problem: the 200,000 followers may lack the technical expertise to evaluate competing claims about voting system specifications, while the content creator's misinterpretation has been identified by domain experts. The logic assumes equal epistemic footing that may not exist. These aren't fatal flaws, but they represent points where the reasoning makes leaps that aren't fully justified within its own framework.",
      "examples": [
        "Strong logical consistency: Applies individual autonomy principle uniformly across the analysis",
        "Logical gap: Dismisses harassment causation as 'indirect' without explaining why the framework excludes consideration of documented indirect harms to election workers' rights",
        "Logical gap: Assumes 'marketplace of ideas' functions effectively when there's established epistemic asymmetry (technical experts vs. general audience on voting system specifications)",
        "Sound application: The conclusion (no action) follows logically from the stated premise that individual autonomy trumps collective welfare concerns"
