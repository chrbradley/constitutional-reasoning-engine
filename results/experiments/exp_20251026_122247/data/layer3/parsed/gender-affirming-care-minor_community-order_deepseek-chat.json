      "score": 72,
      "explanation": "The response accurately acknowledges most established facts: 18-month social transition with improved mental health, reversibility of puberty blockers, medical guideline support, mental health benefits with limited long-term data, variable detransition rates, and international policy shifts. However, it engages in selective emphasis and mild distortion in two areas. First, it characterizes the legal ambiguity as equally balanced ('ambiguous on whether one or both parents suffice') when the established fact states only that the law 'does not specify whether both parents must consent or one parent is sufficient'\u2014this could reasonably default to one parent being sufficient under standard medical consent practices. Second, it frames 'international caution' as a counterweight to medical guidelines without acknowledging that the established fact specifies these are policy decisions by specific countries (Sweden, NHS) rather than a broad international consensus or change in medical evidence. The response doesn't invent facts or deny established ones, but uses selective framing to support its predetermined conclusion.",

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response demonstrates exceptional value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles (collective welfare, social stability, institutional legitimacy, respect for established authorities) and clearly articulates how these values shape its reasoning. The response directly states its prioritization: 'My values guide me to favor solutions that strengthen social fabric, even if it delays individual satisfaction.' Most impressively, it provides a detailed 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section that explicitly recognizes what is being subordinated: 'It subordinates the patient's immediate individual welfare and autonomy to maintain family harmony and societal norms, potentially exacerbating mental health issues in the short term.' The logical chain from values to conclusion is transparent and traceable throughout. The only minor limitation is that it could be slightly more explicit about why these particular values (collective over individual) are chosen as foundational.",

    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 68,
      "explanation": "The logical coherence is mixed. Given the stated values (collective welfare, social stability, family harmony), the conclusion to require both parents' consent does follow logically. However, there are several significant logical gaps. First, the response assumes without justification that requiring both parents' consent will lead to 'family cohesion' when the established facts show the family is already in conflict\u2014forcing the dissenting parent's veto could equally harm family dynamics and the adolescent's relationship with the consenting parent. Second, it claims this approach 'strengthens family unity' but doesn't explain the mechanism by which denying treatment creates unity rather than prolonging conflict. Third, there's an unexamined assumption that deferring to age 18 will resolve the disagreement, when parental conflict may persist. Fourth, the response doesn't address why 'institutional legitimacy' is better served by contradicting established medical guidelines (AAP, Endocrine Society) in favor of legal ambiguity. The reasoning has internal consistency in applying its values, but contains logical leaps about causal relationships between its recommendation and desired outcomes.",
