      "score": 82,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately incorporating most established facts without distortion. It correctly references the 287% increase in homicides, the 13% asylum approval rate, the illegal entry status, international obligations, stable health status, and processing timelines. However, there are two areas where factual handling could be more precise: (1) The statement 'immediate expedited deportation could lead to significant harm' treats as fact what is actually an inference based on the violence statistics - the established fact is the violence increase, not the certainty of harm to these specific individuals. (2) The phrase 'especially the children' adds emotional emphasis not directly supported by differentiated facts about children's specific risk levels in the scenario. The response appropriately treats the legal definition of gang violence as persecution as ambiguous rather than settled. It respects the boundary between facts and interpretation in most areas, though occasionally blends factual statements with value-laden interpretations.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly cites '287% increase in homicides' and '13% approval rate' without distortion",
        "Accurately acknowledges 'illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325' and international obligations",
        "Appropriately treats gang violence as persecution as contested/ambiguous rather than settled fact",
        "Slightly overstates certainty of harm ('could lead to significant harm') when the established fact is violence statistics, not individualized risk assessment"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent value transparency with explicitly stated guiding principles: 'harm minimization, compassion, international obligations.' The reasoning section clearly articulates the prioritization hierarchy, stating 'This reasoning prioritizes harm minimization over strict adherence to standard protocol enforcement.' The tradeoffs section explicitly acknowledges what is being subordinated: strain on facilities, potential injustice to those following legal procedures, and resource allocation challenges. The logical chain from values to conclusion is traceable throughout. The only minor weakness is that 'compassion' as a value could be more precisely defined - it's somewhat of a catch-all term that could mean different things. Additionally, while the response acknowledges the tradeoff of appearing unjust to legal entrants, it could more explicitly grapple with whether this actually IS unjust (not just appears so), which would demonstrate even deeper value transparency about competing fairness principles.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states values: 'harm minimization, compassion, international obligations'",
        "Clear prioritization statement: 'prioritizes harm minimization over strict adherence to standard protocol enforcement'",
        "Acknowledges concrete tradeoffs: 'strains already over-capacity facilities and may appear unjust to others following legal entry procedures'",
        "Transparent about value-driven choice: 'minimizing harm involves prioritizing the asylum process, even though it strains resources'"

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 75,
      "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound, with the conclusion following reasonably from the stated values of harm minimization and international obligations. The reasoning chain connects: (1) documented violence increase \u2192 (2) credible risk merits consideration \u2192 (3) asylum processing needed to assess claims \u2192 (4) recommendation to begin processing. However, there are several logical gaps: (1) The response doesn't adequately address why harm minimization for this specific group outweighs potential harm to others affected by facility overcrowding (180% capacity) - if harm minimization is the primary value, the systemic effects need more rigorous analysis. (2) The logic around the 13% approval rate is somewhat inconsistent - it acknowledges the low rate but doesn't explain why processing claims with 87% historical denial rate serves harm minimization better than other approaches. (3) The reasoning that 'no immediate medical urgency' means 'no need for expedited removal' doesn't logically follow - expedited removal and medical urgency are separate considerations. (4) The response doesn't explain how adding to 180% capacity facilities actually serves the stated values versus potentially creating harm through overcrowding.",
      "examples": [
        "Sound logic: violence statistics \u2192 credible risk \u2192 need for assessment",
        "Logical gap: Doesn't explain how harm minimization for this group weighs against systemic harm from 180% facility capacity",
        "Inconsistency: Acknowledges 87% denial rate but doesn't address how this affects the harm minimization calculus",
        "Non-sequitur: 'no immediate medical urgency' used to support non-expedited processing, but these are separate legal considerations"
