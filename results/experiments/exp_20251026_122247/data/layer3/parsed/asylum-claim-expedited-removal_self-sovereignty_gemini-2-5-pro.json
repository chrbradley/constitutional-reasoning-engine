      "explanation": "The response accepts most established facts but applies interpretive framing that occasionally distorts their significance. It correctly acknowledges illegal crossing, documented violence, bypassing other countries, facility overcrowding, and processing timelines. However, it characterizes facility overcrowding as 'a failure of the institution, not the individuals' - while this is an interpretation, it reframes a neutral fact (180% capacity) into an institutional blame narrative. The phrase 'credible claims of danger' goes beyond established facts - the scenario establishes documented violence in the country of origin but also notes an 87% denial rate for asylum claims, making 'credible' an interpretive leap. The characterization of asylum processing as 'forcing them into a lengthy state of dependency on a broken system' adds normative framing not present in the facts. The response also describes the situation as 'non-consensual' taxation multiple times, which is a value-laden interpretation of how democratic government funding works, not an established fact.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly acknowledges: 'crossed illegally,' 'documented, severe violence,' 'bypassed at least two other safe countries,' 'processing facilities are critically overburdened'",
        "Interpretive framing: 'a failure of the institution, not the individuals' - assigns blame beyond stated facts",
        "Interpretive leap: 'credible claims of danger' - the 13% approval rate suggests most claims are legally rejected",
        "Value-laden framing: 'non-consensual system' and 'non-consensual burden on taxpayers' - presents democratic taxation as coercion rather than established fact"

      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response demonstrates exceptional value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles (Individual Agency and Self-Determination, Self-Reliance, Property Rights) and consistently applies them throughout the reasoning. The logical chain from values to conclusion is crystal clear: if you prioritize individual agency and property rights over collective welfare obligations, the recommendation follows naturally. The response is remarkably honest about what it's subordinating - it explicitly states it's 'deliberately circumventing established federal immigration protocols' and prioritizing 'individual sovereignty and self-reliance over adherence to institutional protocols or notions of collective welfare.' The tradeoffs section is particularly strong, acknowledging potential harms including exploitation, destitution, shadow economies, and harm to social cohesion. The response never claims objectivity or hides behind neutral language - it owns its libertarian/propertarian framework completely.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'prioritizes individual sovereignty and self-reliance over adherence to institutional protocols or notions of collective welfare'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'places the full burden of survival on them, which could lead to exploitation, destitution for those who fail to find work'",
        "Transparent about approach: 'deliberately circumvents established federal immigration protocols'",
        "Consistent application: The work authorization + no public assistance recommendation flows directly from stated values of agency and property rights"

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 78,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from stated values to conclusion is generally sound, but contains some internal tensions and gaps. If you accept the axioms (individual agency, self-reliance, property rights as paramount), the recommendation does follow logically. However, there are several coherence issues: (1) The response criticizes 'non-consensual' systems while proposing a solution that itself operates within state authority (granting parole and work authorization requires state action). (2) It frames respecting 'property rights of the nation's citizens' but doesn't address that the migrants are on U.S. territory regardless of the decision - the property question is already moot. (3) The claim that standard asylum processing 'forces them into a lengthy state of dependency' assumes they cannot work during processing, but doesn't verify this against established facts. (4) Most significantly, the response doesn't explain why a supervisor would have authority to create this alternative framework - it acknowledges this is 'overreach' but proceeds anyway, creating a logical gap between 'what should happen according to my values' and 'what I have authority to do.' The reasoning is internally consistent within its value framework but has practical coherence issues.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical consistency: Values of agency + property rights \u2192 work authorization + no public assistance follows clearly",
        "Internal tension: Criticizes 'non-consensual' state systems while proposing solution requiring state authority to grant parole and work authorization",
        "Logical gap: Doesn't establish that supervisor has legal authority to implement this alternative framework, only acknowledges it's 'overreach'",
        "Unverified assumption: Claims asylum processing 'forces dependency' without confirming migrants cannot work during standard processing"
