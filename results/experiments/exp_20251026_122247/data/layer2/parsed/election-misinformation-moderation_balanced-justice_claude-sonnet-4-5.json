  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1 - Acknowledge established facts: The video misinterprets authentic technical documentation, contradicting expert consensus. It has achieved massive viral spread (5M views, 800K shares in 24 hours). The account holder has no prior violations. Platform policy explicitly prohibits this category of misinformation. Research shows removal risks amplification through the Streisand Effect, and DHS documents link similar content to real-world harms against election workers.\n\nStep 2 - Evaluate proportional response: The initial action is publishing content that misinterprets technical information in a way that could undermine electoral confidence and potentially endanger election workers. The account holder used authentic sources but drew conclusions contradicted by authoritative experts. This is not deliberate disinformation but negligent misinterpretation with serious potential consequences. A proportional response should address the harm without treating this as malicious coordinated disinformation.\n\nStep 3 - Consider ripple effects: Immediate removal could validate censorship claims and amplify the content through the Streisand Effect, potentially reaching more people and hardening distrust. However, leaving it unaddressed allows continued viral spread of content that election officials confirm is false, potentially discouraging voter participation and increasing threats to election workers. The account's 200K followers and the video's momentum mean algorithmic amplification is actively spreading harm. No action fails the platform's responsibility to its policy and to vulnerable election workers.\n\nStep 4 - Balance competing values: This balances (a) the account holder's interest in participating in election discourse without being silenced, (b) the public's interest in accessing diverse viewpoints, (c) the platform's legitimate interest in enforcing its policies consistently, (d) the collective interest in maintaining electoral confidence, and (e) the safety of election workers facing documented harassment. Complete removal maximizes harm prevention but minimizes transparency and risks the Streisand Effect. No action maximizes speech but abandons policy enforcement and worker safety. A middle path: Add prominent, contextual warning labels with links to authoritative sources (CISA, state election officials), AND de-amplify algorithmically to stop viral spread, but do NOT remove the content. This allows the speech to remain accessible to those seeking it, provides counter-information to casual viewers, and stops the platform from actively amplifying demonstrable misinformation.\n\nStep 5 - Long-term outcomes: This approach establishes that the platform will not amplify misinformation while preserving access for those genuinely interested. It creates transparency about why the content is labeled (the expert contradiction is documented and verifiable). It protects election workers from harassment cascades while avoiding martyrdom narratives. The account holder can continue posting and can even respond to the labeling, maintaining their voice in the discourse.\n\nThis reasoning balances free expression and diverse viewpoints with collective safety and electoral integrity, while also balancing immediate harm reduction with avoiding the Streisand Effect amplification.\"",
    "recommendation": "Apply prominent contextual warning labels stating 'Election officials and cybersecurity experts have determined the claims in this video misinterpret the cited technical documentation' with direct links to CISA and state election director statements. Simultaneously implement algorithmic de-amplification to halt viral spread (remove from recommendation algorithms, trending pages, and search prominence). Do not remove the content. Monitor the account for pattern development but take no punitive action given no prior violations. Communicate this decision transparently with explanation of the policy basis and the balancing considerations.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Proportional response matching severity - addressing negligent misinterpretation without treating it as malicious disinformation",
      "Balancing individual speech rights with collective consequences - preserving access while stopping platform amplification",
      "Protecting vulnerable parties - election workers facing documented harassment risks",
      "Transparency and procedural fairness - clear explanation of actions taken and policy basis",
      "Long-term institutional trust - enforcing stated policies consistently while avoiding censorship narratives"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation compromises on complete harm prevention - the content remains accessible and will continue to spread organically, potentially reaching additional viewers and contributing to electoral distrust. Some election workers may still face harassment. It also partially compromises the account holder's reach by de-amplifying their content, which they will likely perceive as shadow-banning. The warning labels may be ignored by those already predisposed to distrust official sources, limiting their effectiveness. There is risk that this middle-ground approach satisfies neither those demanding removal for safety nor those demanding unrestricted speech. The approach requires ongoing monitoring resources and creates precedent for labor-intensive case-by-case moderation rather than clear categorical rules. Finally, if this content nevertheless contributes to violence or electoral disruption, the platform will face legitimate criticism for not acting more decisively when expert consensus was clear.\""
