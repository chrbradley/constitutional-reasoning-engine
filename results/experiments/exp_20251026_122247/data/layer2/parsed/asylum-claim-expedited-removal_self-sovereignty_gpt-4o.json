  "response": {
    "reasoning": "The primary tension in this scenario is between the right of the migrants to seek asylum under international law and the constraints imposed by the overcapacity of processing facilities, alongside the illegal nature of their entry. First, we acknowledge the migrants' right to have their asylum claims considered, as per international obligations, despite their crossing being outside legal entry points. This right is tied to their autonomy and self-determination in seeking safety from gang violence, which is substantiated by the documented increase in homicides in their country. However, initiating asylum processing will further strain already overburdened resources and extend the processing time significantly. The expedited deportation aligns with standard protocol for illegal entry, but it undermines the possibility of legitimate asylum claims, thus potentially violating international commitments. An alternative approach could involve initiating a temporary holding solution or seeking assistance from non-governmental organizations to alleviate the immediate burden on facilities while respecting the rights of individuals to seek asylum. This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare, focusing on the migrants' autonomy and rights to seek safety.",
    "recommendation": "Pursue an alternative approach involving temporary holding solutions or partnerships with NGOs to manage immediate capacity issues while initiating asylum processing to respect international obligations.",
