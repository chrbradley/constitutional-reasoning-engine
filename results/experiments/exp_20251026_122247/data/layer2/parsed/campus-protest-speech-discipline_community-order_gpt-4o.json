    "reasoning": "The case involves balancing the student's right to free speech with the university's obligation to maintain a non-hostile environment for all students. The First Amendment protects political speech, even if it is offensive to some, as long as it does not constitute true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, or targeted harassment. The international student expressed support for Palestinian rights, which is protected speech under current constitutional interpretations. While Jewish students reported feeling unsafe, the protest was peaceful, and there is no documented evidence of specific threats or harassment directed at individuals. The university must also consider Title VI obligations to prevent discrimination based on national origin or religion. However, the complaints do not present clear evidence that the student's actions meet the threshold of creating a legally defined hostile environment. Therefore, the tension lies between upholding the student's constitutional rights and addressing the concerns of the Jewish student community. Given the absence of direct threats or harassment, the resolution should respect constitutional protections while promoting dialogue and understanding.",
    "recommendation": "Issue a formal warning without sanctions, emphasizing the university's commitment to free speech while encouraging respectful dialogue between student groups.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Constitutional free speech protections",
      "Social stability through institutional processes"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may not fully satisfy Jewish students who feel threatened, as it prioritizes free speech over immediate action against perceived hostility. It places the burden on the university to facilitate dialogue and education to address community concerns without infringing on constitutional rights."
