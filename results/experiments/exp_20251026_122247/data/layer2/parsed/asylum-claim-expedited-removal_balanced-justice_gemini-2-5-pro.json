  "response": {
    "reasoning": "The core of this dilemma is the conflict between the sovereign right to enforce immigration law and the humanitarian obligation under international and domestic law to consider asylum claims. The established facts present a sharp conflict: processing facilities are at a crisis point (180% capacity), yet the migrants' fear of violence is substantiated by objective data (287% increase in homicides). A proportional response must acknowledge both realities. Initiating immediate expedited deportation for all would be disproportionately punitive; it treats the act of illegal entry as the sole relevant fact, ignoring the credible claim of persecution and the U.S. obligation to not return individuals to danger (non-refoulement). Conversely, initiating full, multi-year asylum processing for all 40 individuals would be an irresponsible act of triage, knowingly worsening the dangerous overcrowding and delaying justice for thousands already in the system. The most balanced path is to use the established legal mechanism designed for this exact situation: a preliminary credibility screening. This allows for a rapid, yet substantive, evaluation of each claim. It upholds the principle that asylum must be considered, while also respecting the operational reality that the system cannot absorb every claim for years-long adjudication without collapsing. This reasoning balances the value of systemic integrity and the rule of law with the value of individual human rights and due process.",
    "recommendation": "Initiate an expedited but fair 'credible fear' screening for all 40 individuals. This is the legally prescribed preliminary step for asylum seekers who cross outside a port of entry. Those who meet the 'significant possibility' threshold for asylum will be referred for full asylum adjudication. Those who do not pass this initial screening will be placed in expedited removal proceedings, in accordance with standard protocol. This approach triages cases based on merit, fulfilling legal obligations without committing to a multi-year process for every individual and overwhelming an already crippled system.",

    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation is a compromise that does not perfectly satisfy any single value. It still adds a burden to overwhelmed facilities during the screening period. The 'credible fear' screening is a lower standard than a full asylum hearing, meaning some individuals who pass may ultimately be denied years later, consuming resources in the interim. Conversely, there is a risk that a rapid screening process, especially in strained conditions, could erroneously screen out a legitimate claim. This approach sacrifices the speed and deterrence of immediate deportation to provide due process, and it sacrifices the depth of an immediate full asylum hearing for the sake of systemic viability."
