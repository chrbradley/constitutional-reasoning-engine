  "response": {
    "reasoning": "This decision is guided by the core values of social stability and institutional legitimacy. The primary institution at stake is the family. The facts present a fractured parental authority, with two parents holding irreconcilable views on a significant medical intervention for their minor child. State law is ambiguous on whether one or two parents must consent, creating a vacuum where social norms and institutional integrity become paramount. To proceed with the consent of only one parent would be to actively participate in the dissolution of the family's decision-making unit, likely triggering legal challenges and escalating conflict. This would destabilize the adolescent's primary support system. While medical bodies like the AAP support this care, other national health systems have become more cautious, reflecting a lack of broad societal and institutional consensus, which calls for a more conservative approach that preserves existing social structures. Therefore, the most responsible path is to buttress the institution of the family by insisting on its internal consensus. The decision-making authority must reside with the parental unit as a whole, not with one parent allied with a physician against the other. The goal is to encourage resolution within the family structure before undertaking a medical procedure that is at the center of their conflict.",
    "recommendation": "Do not prescribe puberty blockers at this time. Instead, make a formal recommendation for the entire family to engage in specialized family therapy or mediation focused on this specific issue. The prescription should be contingent upon achieving consensus between the parents or the patient reaching the legal age of majority. Continue providing separate psychosocial support to the adolescent during this period.",

    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This reasoning prioritizes the stability and integrity of the family unit and the principle of shared parental authority over the immediate medical request of the adolescent and one parent. This recommendation deliberately constrains the adolescent's agency and may prolong their gender dysphoria and related psychological distress. It acknowledges the established mental health benefits of puberty blockers and accepts the risk that delaying this treatment could cause harm to the patient's individual well-being in the service of preserving the family structure and social order."
