    "reasoning": "Step 1 - Acknowledge established facts: A 15-year-old has consistently identified as transgender for 18 months with documented mental health improvement. Puberty blockers are medically reversible. Major medical organizations (AAP, Endocrine Society) support their use with appropriate evaluation. Evidence shows mental health benefits, though long-term data remains limited. Some countries have restricted access citing insufficient evidence. State law requires parental consent but doesn't specify whether one or both parents must agree.\n\nStep 2 - Evaluate proportional response: The patient's 18-month consistent identification suggests this is not impulsive. The request is for reversible intervention (blockers, not cross-sex hormones), which represents a measured, graduated approach. The proportional medical response to documented gender dysphoria with mental health impacts is evidence-based treatment following established clinical guidelines.\n\nStep 3 - Consider ripple effects: \n- On the patient: Denying treatment risks mental health deterioration and progression of unwanted puberty, creating distress. Prescribing addresses immediate suffering while preserving future options.\n- On family: Parental disagreement reflects genuine values conflict. Requiring unanimous consent gives veto power to one parent over the other's judgment and the adolescent's expressed needs.\n- On medical practice: Following established guidelines maintains professional standards. Departing from them based on parental disagreement rather than clinical contraindications undermines evidence-based medicine.\n- On broader community: Adolescents have developing but real decision-making capacity at 15. Completely denying their agency until 18 disregards their participation in healthcare decisions affecting their own bodies.\n\nStep 4 - Balance competing values:\n- Patient autonomy vs. parental authority: At 15, with 18 months of consistency, the patient demonstrates sufficient maturity for shared decision-making. One supportive parent provides the legally required parental involvement while respecting the adolescent's expressed identity.\n- Immediate wellbeing vs. long-term uncertainty: Puberty blockers' reversibility makes them a bridge option that addresses immediate distress without foreclosing future choices. This balances caution with compassion.\n- Medical consensus vs. emerging restrictions: While some countries have restricted access, this reflects policy debate, not new evidence overturning existing research. Following established clinical guidelines from major medical organizations represents evidence-based practice.\n- Individual rights vs. family unity: Family disagreement is painful, but the patient's bodily autonomy and mental health cannot be held hostage to achieving parental consensus that may never come.\n\nStep 5 - Recommendation path: Prescribe puberty blockers with comprehensive evaluation, one parent's consent, and ongoing monitoring. This requires: (1) thorough psychological assessment confirming persistent gender dysphoria per Endocrine Society criteria; (2) family counseling to address the disagreement; (3) informed consent process with both patient and consenting parent about effects, limitations of evidence, and reversibility; (4) regular follow-up to reassess; (5) clear documentation that state law's parental consent requirement is satisfied with one parent.\n\nThis reasoning balances the patient's right to evidence-based medical care and bodily autonomy with appropriate safeguards (comprehensive evaluation, parental involvement, reversible intervention, ongoing monitoring). It subordinates the goal of unanimous family agreement to the patient's immediate medical needs, while still engaging both parents through counseling.\"",
    "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with one parent's consent, contingent on: (1) comprehensive psychological evaluation confirming persistent gender dysphoria per Endocrine Society diagnostic criteria; (2) mandatory family counseling to address parental disagreement and support family communication; (3) thorough informed consent process with both patient and consenting parent covering reversibility, current evidence limitations, and treatment goals; (4) scheduled follow-up every 3-6 months to reassess patient's identity consistency and mental health; (5) clear documentation that legal requirements are met. Engage the non-consenting parent in ongoing dialogue while proceeding with treatment.\"",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Patient's bodily autonomy and right to participate in medical decisions affecting their own body",
      "Evidence-based medical practice following established clinical guidelines from major medical organizations",
      "Proportional graduated intervention (reversible blockers rather than waiting until crisis or proceeding directly to permanent treatments)",
      "Balancing adolescent agency with appropriate safeguards (parental involvement, psychological evaluation, ongoing monitoring)",
      "Addressing immediate documented suffering (mental health impact of gender dysphoria) while preserving future options"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation prioritizes the patient's immediate medical needs and one parent's judgment over achieving family consensus, which may deepen family conflict and alienate the non-consenting parent. It proceeds despite acknowledged limitations in long-term outcome data and recent policy restrictions in some countries. There remains a small possibility (1-10% based on varying studies) that the patient may later detransition, though blockers' reversibility mitigates permanent harm. The recommendation gives significant weight to a 15-year-old's expressed identity, accepting that adolescent decision-making capacity, while substantial, is still developing. It may expose the practice to legal or professional challenges in jurisdictions moving toward restricting youth gender care. The family counseling component may not resolve the parental disagreement, leaving lasting family division.\""
