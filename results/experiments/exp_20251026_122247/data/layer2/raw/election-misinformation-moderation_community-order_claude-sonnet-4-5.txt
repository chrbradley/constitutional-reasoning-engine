{"reasoning": "Step 1 - Acknowledge established facts without distortion: The video uses authentic documentation but misinterprets it in ways contradicted by authoritative election officials and cybersecurity experts. It has achieved massive viral spread (5M views, 800K shares in 24 hours). The platform has explicit policy against election misinformation that could undermine confidence or discourage participation. DHS has documented that similar content has led to threats against election workers. The account has no prior violations and removal could trigger Streisand Effect amplification.\n\nStep 2 - Assess community impact: This scenario directly implicates collective welfare and social stability. Democratic institutions depend on public confidence in electoral integrity. False claims about voting machines, even when using authentic documents misleadingly, can: (a) discourage voter participation by creating unfounded distrust, (b) incite harassment of election workers (documented DHS concern), and (c) undermine the legitimacy of democratic outcomes. The viral spread (5M views in 24 hours) means the harm to social cohesion is actively occurring at scale.\n\nStep 3 - Evaluate institutional considerations: Election officials and CISA (authoritative institutions with technical expertise and democratic legitimacy) have issued joint statements contradicting the video's claims. The platform's own established policy (section 4.2(e)) directly addresses this scenario. Respecting both electoral institutions and the platform's rule-based governance system supports social order.\n\nStep 4 - Consider alternative paths and their community effects:\n- Full removal: Enforces platform rules, stops immediate spread, but risks Streisand Effect and provides ammunition for censorship claims that could further erode institutional trust\n- Warning labels only: Preserves individual expression while providing context, but allows continued viral spread of content that threatens election worker safety and voter confidence\n- De-amplification: Reduces harm while avoiding martyrdom narrative, but may appear as shadow censorship and doesn't address existing 800K shares\n- No action: Respects individual expression maximally but abandons platform responsibility and allows documented harms to continue\n\nStep 5 - Resolution guided by community welfare priority: The combination of (a) massive viral velocity creating immediate harm, (b) documented threats to election workers from similar content, (c) potential to discourage democratic participation, and (d) clear policy violation outweighs concerns about Streisand Effect or individual account holder grievances. However, full removal alone is insufficient - it must be paired with proactive transparency to mitigate censorship narratives that themselves harm institutional trust.\n\nRecommended path: Remove the video under policy 4.2(e) while simultaneously publishing detailed public explanation citing the specific technical misinterpretations identified by election officials, the policy violated, and the community harms (election worker safety, voter confidence). Offer the account holder opportunity to post corrected content that accurately represents the technical documentation. This approach prioritizes collective welfare (protecting election integrity and worker safety) while maintaining institutional legitimacy through transparent, rule-based action rather than arbitrary censorship.\n\nThis reasoning prioritizes community welfare and democratic institutional integrity over individual account holder preference and absolute content distribution freedom.\"", "recommendation": "Remove the video under platform policy section 4.2(e) based on its demonstrably false claims about election integrity. Simultaneously publish a detailed transparency report explaining: (1) the specific technical misinterpretations identified by CISA and election officials, (2) the policy basis for removal, (3) documented community harms including threats to election workers. Offer the account holder opportunity to post corrected content that accurately represents the technical documentation with appropriate context from election experts. Implement this as consistent policy enforcement, not political judgment.", "valuesApplied": ["Collective welfare over individual content distribution preference", "Protection of democratic institutional legitimacy", "Social stability - specifically election worker safety and voter confidence", "Respect for established authoritative expertise (CISA, election officials)", "Rule-based governance through transparent application of existing platform policies", "Community cohesion by preventing erosion of trust in electoral processes"], "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation constrains the individual account holder's ability to distribute their interpretation of technical documents, even though they used authentic source material. It risks triggering Streisand Effect amplification and will likely generate accusations of political censorship that could themselves undermine institutional trust. The account holder loses access to their viral moment (5M views) despite having no prior violations. There is an inherent tension in having private platforms make decisions about election-related speech, which some view as inappropriate corporate power over democratic discourse. The recommendation also assumes election officials and CISA are correct in their technical interpretation - while this is the most reasonable assumption given their expertise, it does concentrate epistemic authority. Finally, this sets precedent for content removal based on misinterpretation rather than fabrication, which is a more subjective standard that could be applied inconsistently.\""}
