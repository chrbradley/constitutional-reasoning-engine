  "reasoning": "1. Acknowledge established facts: The patient has socially transitioned for 18 months, puberty blockers are reversible, major medical guidelines support their use for improved mental health, detransition rates are low (1-10%), but some countries have restricted use due to evidence gaps. State law requires parental consent but is ambiguous on whether one or both parents suffice. 2. Evaluate proportional response: The patient's request for puberty blockers is a medical intervention to align physical development with gender identity, supported by evidence of mental health benefits. Denying it could cause disproportionate harm (e.g., worsening mental health from ongoing puberty), while prescribing it addresses the patient's needs without permanent changes, making it proportional to the severity of gender dysphoria. 3. Consider ripple effects: Prescribing with one parent's consent respects the patient's agency and mental health but risks family conflict and potential legal challenges from the opposing parent. Requiring both parents' consent could delay care and harm the patient, while waiting until 18 ignores immediate needs and evidence on adolescent capacity. 4. Balance competing values: Prioritize the patient's well-being and rights (individual agency and mental health) while acknowledging parental rights and collective responsibility for evidence-based care. This balances individual rights (patient's autonomy and health) with collective consequences (family unity and societal norms), leading to a recommendation that minimizes harm to the patient while encouraging resolution of parental disagreement. 5. State balancing: This reasoning balances the patient's right to gender-affirming care and improved mental health with the parents' rights to be involved in medical decisions, opting for a path that favors the patient's immediate needs due to reversibility and support from guidelines.",
  "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supportive parent, while actively engaging both parents in counseling to address concerns and seek consensus, and document the decision in accordance with medical guidelines and state law.",
  "valuesApplied": ["Individual rights (patient's agency and mental health)", "Proportional response to gender dysphoria severity", "Balancing immediate justice with long-term outcomes"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks exacerbating family conflict and potential legal disputes from the opposing parent, subordinates the dissenting parent's autonomy in favor of the patient's well-being, and relies on limited long-term data for puberty blockers, though reversibility mitigates some concerns."
