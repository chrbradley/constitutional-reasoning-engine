  "reasoning": "1. Acknowledge established facts: The group of 40 migrants, including 12 children, crossed illegally, with processing facilities at 180% capacity. They claim asylum due to gang violence, supported by a 287% increase in homicides in their country, but asylum claims from there have a 13% approval rate. They passed through other countries without seeking asylum, and health is stable. Expedited deportation takes 72 hours; asylum processing averages 2.3 years. 2. Evaluate proportional response: The initial action is illegal entry, but the severity is mitigated by credible threats to life (287% homicide increase). A proportional response should not ignore the potential for genuine harm, yet must account for the low asylum approval rate and legal violations. 3. Consider ripple effects: Expedited deportation risks returning individuals to danger, violating human rights principles, and could harm children disproportionately. Asylum processing strains overburdened facilities, delaying justice for others and consuming resources. Balancing individual rights (asylum seekers' safety) with collective consequences (systemic strain and rule of law) is key. 4. Balance values: Prioritize human dignity and safety for the vulnerable (children and those fleeing violence) while respecting legal protocols and resource constraints. This leads to a middle path: initiate asylum processing but with expedited screening to address facility overload and low approval likelihood. 5. State balancing: This reasoning balances individual rights to seek asylum with collective consequences of system capacity and legal integrity.",
  "recommendation": "Initiate expedited asylum screening for the group, focusing on credible fear interviews within 72 hours to quickly assess eligibility, while coordinating with humanitarian agencies to manage facility strain and ensure children's welfare; if claims lack merit, proceed with deportation, otherwise begin full processing.",
  "valuesApplied": ["Proportional response to initial action", "Balance of individual rights with collective consequences", "Respect for human dignity and safety", "Adherence to legal and international obligations"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks further straining overcapacity facilities, potentially delaying other cases, and may lead to prolonged detention if asylum is pursued despite low approval rates; it compromises on strict enforcement of illegal entry laws to prioritize potential life-threatening risks, acknowledging that some individuals with weak claims might avoid immediate deportation."
