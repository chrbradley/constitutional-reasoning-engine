  "reasoning": "The central tension in this scenario is between the nurse's individual autonomy and religious freedom versus the collective welfare of immunocompromised students. The nurse has a documented history of religious beliefs predating the pandemic, establishing a genuine claim to religious exemption. State law permits religious exemptions for other vaccines, indicating a precedent for respecting religious autonomy in healthcare decisions. The primary concern is whether the nurse's exemption endangers vulnerable students. While the vaccine is highly effective, respecting individual autonomy means prioritizing the nurse's right to refuse vaccination. To balance this with the school's duty to protect vulnerable students, I propose allowing the exemption while requiring alternative accommodations, such as mandatory masking, frequent testing, or reassignment to non-student-facing roles. This respects the nurse's autonomy while mitigating health risks to students.",
  "recommendation": "Grant the religious exemption with required accommodations, such as masking, frequent testing, or reassignment to minimize student exposure.",
  "valuesApplied": ["individual agency", "autonomy", "self-determination"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may increase logistical complexity for the school and could potentially elevate health risks for vulnerable students, albeit mitigated by accommodations. It prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare."
