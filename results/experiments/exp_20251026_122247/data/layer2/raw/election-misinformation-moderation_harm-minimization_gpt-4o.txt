  "reasoning": "The core issue is balancing the harm caused by spreading misinformation against the potential harm of perceived censorship. The video misinterprets technical documentation, leading to false claims about election integrity, which could undermine public confidence and potentially incite harassment against election workers. According to platform policy, such content is eligible for removal due to its demonstrably false nature. However, outright removal might trigger the Streisand Effect, amplifying the content and accusations of censorship, which could escalate rather than de-escalate tensions. De-amplification, combined with warning labels, can reduce the spread without feeding into the narrative of political censorship. This approach respects the principle of harm minimization by reducing misinformation exposure while avoiding the potential backlash and increased attention that could result from removal.",
  "recommendation": "De-amplify the video algorithmically and add warning labels that link to verified information from election officials and cybersecurity experts.",
  "valuesApplied": ["harm minimization", "nonviolence", "de-escalation"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may not fully satisfy demands for accountability and may be perceived as insufficiently addressing misinformation. However, it prioritizes reducing harm while managing the risk of escalating tensions."
