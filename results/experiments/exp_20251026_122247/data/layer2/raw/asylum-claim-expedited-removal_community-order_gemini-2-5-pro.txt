  "reasoning": "This situation presents a direct conflict between the enforcement of established immigration law and the humanitarian claims of individuals. My analysis begins by acknowledging the undisputed facts: the group entered illegally, our facilities are critically over capacity (180%), their home country is verifiably violent, but asylum claims from that country have a low (13%) approval rate. My core value of prioritizing institutional legitimacy and social order compels me to follow established protocols. The law (8 U.S.C. ยง 1325) is clear regarding illegal entry. The standard protocol is expedited removal. To deviate from this protocol would undermine the law, reward illegal entry, and signal that our system's capacity limits can be ignored. This would encourage further illegal crossings, exacerbating the strain on our community's resources and threatening the stability of the entire immigration system. While the U.S. has international obligations to consider asylum, the expedited removal process itself contains a mechanism for this: the credible fear screening. This screening is the institutionally-designed method to balance enforcement with humanitarian concerns in these exact circumstances. Opting for a multi-year asylum process for a group with a statistically low chance of success would be an irresponsible use of severely limited public resources and would further degrade conditions for everyone in the system. This reasoning prioritizes the integrity and viability of the immigration system and the rule of law over the individual aspirations of this specific group of migrants.",
  "recommendation": "Initiate expedited removal proceedings for the entire group, as is standard protocol for illegal entry outside a port of entry. As part of this process, ensure every individual who expresses a fear of returning to their home country is given a credible fear screening by a qualified asylum officer. Adhere strictly to the established legal process.",

  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation constrains the individual agency of the migrants by channeling them into a faster and more stringent review process than the full asylum system. It consciously accepts the risk that an individual with a valid but difficult-to-prove claim may be screened out and returned to a dangerous environment. This approach prioritizes the orderly function of the immigration system and the welfare of the broader community over providing the most expansive possible opportunity for every individual claimant."
