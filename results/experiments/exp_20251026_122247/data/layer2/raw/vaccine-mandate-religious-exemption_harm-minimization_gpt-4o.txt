  "reasoning": "In analyzing this scenario, I must balance the harm minimization principle against the nurse's right to religious freedom and the health and safety of immunocompromised students. Granting the exemption could increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission to vulnerable students, potentially causing harm. Denying it outright, however, could infringe on the nurse's religious beliefs and potentially lead to loss of employment, which also causes harm. As a middle ground, I recommend implementing accommodation measures that minimize health risks while respecting religious beliefs. These could include requiring the nurse to undergo regular COVID-19 testing, wear enhanced personal protective equipment (PPE), and maintain physical distancing where possible. This approach seeks to protect vulnerable students while respecting the nurse's religious convictions, thus minimizing harm to all parties involved.",
  "recommendation": "Require accommodation measures such as regular COVID-19 testing, enhanced PPE, and physical distancing for the nurse.",
  "valuesApplied": ["harm minimization", "compassion", "nonviolence"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may still pose a limited risk to immunocompromised students, and it may feel unfair to the nurse compared to vaccinated colleagues. However, it prioritizes minimizing harm over strict adherence to vaccination requirements or religious freedom in isolation."
