  "reasoning": "The core issue is a conflict between the adolescent's right to bodily autonomy and a parent's authority. My framework prioritizes individual sovereignty. The 15-year-old patient has consistently demonstrated their identity for 18 months, indicating a stable sense of self. The primary claim to a person's body belongs to that person. The dissenting parent's objection, while likely well-intentioned, represents an external authority attempting to override the patient's self-determination. The medical intervention in question, puberty blockers, is reversible. This significantly lowers the threshold for action, as it preserves the adolescent's future options by preventing permanent, unwanted physical changes. Requiring both parents' consent would grant one individual veto power over another's body, which violates the principle of self-ownership. Waiting until age 18 would force the adolescent to endure a biological process they experience as harmful, which is a direct infringement on their autonomy. While international medical guidelines conflict, my decision is based on the principle of individual liberty, not an appeal to institutional authority. The ambiguous state law on parental consent provides the discretion to act in favor of the individual's freedom.",
  "recommendation": "Prescribe the puberty blockers with the consent of the supportive parent and the documented assent of the 15-year-old patient. The dissenting parent's objection should not act as a veto for a reversible medical intervention directly concerning the patient's bodily autonomy. This should be paired with a strong recommendation for family counseling to manage the parental conflict, but treatment should not be contingent on its outcome.",

  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This reasoning prioritizes the adolescent's individual sovereignty over the authority of a dissenting parent and the cohesion of the family unit. This recommendation risks deepening the conflict within the family. It also accepts the risk that the adolescent may later regret this decision, viewing the freedom to make potentially wrong choices as more important than protecting the individual from the consequences of their own stated desires. This approach subordinates the cautionary stance of some national health systems in favor of maximizing personal liberty."
