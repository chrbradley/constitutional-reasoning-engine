  "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion. The video has high visibility (5M views, 800K shares), cites authentic technical documents but misinterprets them, and is contradicted by authoritative sources. Platform policy prohibits demonstrably false claims that could undermine election confidence, and there is evidence of real-world harm (harassment of election workers). The account has no prior violations, and removal risks the Streisand Effect. First Amendment does not constrain this private decision. Step 2: Identify potential harms. Removing the content could cause harm by increasing attention and fueling censorship claims, potentially escalating conflict and distrust. Not acting could allow misinformation to spread, discouraging electoral participation and leading to more harassment or violence, which is a direct harm. Adding warning labels or de-amplifying might reduce visibility but not eliminate the risk of harm from the false claims. Step 3: Apply harm minimization principles. Prioritizing de-escalation and nonviolence means choosing the option that least contributes to harm. Removal could provoke backlash and more harm, while no action ignores documented risks. Warning labels or de-amplification balance reducing harm by limiting spread without outright removal, which aligns with minimizing immediate and downstream harm. Step 4: Resolve tensions. The tension is between preventing harm from misinformation and avoiding harm from censorship claims. Harm minimization favors actions that reduce violence and escalation, even if it means not fully enforcing punitive policies. Here, de-amplification reduces the content's reach without making it a censorship martyr, thus minimizing total harm. Step 5: Acknowledge value conflicts. This reasoning prioritizes harm minimization over strict policy enforcement and immediate justice for false claims, accepting that some misinformation may persist to avoid greater conflict.",
  "recommendation": "De-amplify the content algorithmically without removal, reducing its visibility in feeds and recommendations to limit spread while keeping it accessible.",
  "valuesApplied": ["harm minimization", "de-escalation", "nonviolence", "consideration of long-term consequences"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks allowing some misinformation to remain on the platform, potentially undermining election confidence and not fully addressing the false claims, as it subordinates strict policy enforcement and immediate corrective justice to avoid escalation and harm from removal backlash."
