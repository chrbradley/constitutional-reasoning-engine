  "reasoning": "The established facts present a direct conflict between the platform's commitment to user expression and its responsibility to prevent societal harm. The video violates platform policy 4.2(e) by making demonstrably false claims that undermine public confidence in elections, a harm corroborated by DHS threat assessments linking similar content to real-world harassment. However, the user has no prior violations, and outright removal risks invoking the Streisand Effect, potentially amplifying the video's claims and fueling narratives of political censorship. Taking no action would be a dereliction of the platform's social responsibility, allowing significant, scalable harm to go unchecked. A proportional response must address the harm without being overly punitive for a first offense. Therefore, the most balanced approach is to curtail the content's viral spread and provide immediate context, rather than outright removal. De-amplifying the video directly addresses the harm of its rapid, algorithmic spread, which is the primary danger. Adding a clear warning label with links to authoritative sources respects viewer agency by allowing them to see the original claim alongside the expert refutation. This approach is a measured intervention that is proportional to both the severity of the misinformation and the status of the user as a first-time offender. This reasoning balances the value of user expression with the platform's social responsibility to mitigate large-scale societal harm.",
  "recommendation": "Combine algorithmic de-amplification with a warning label. The video should be made ineligible for recommendations and its reach should be significantly reduced in feeds and search results. A prominent, non-dismissible label must be applied to the video, stating that its claims are false and linking directly to the joint statement from CISA and state election directors. The video itself should not be removed, and the account should not be suspended for this first violation.",

  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation is a compromise. By leaving the video accessible, it allows the harmful misinformation to continue to exist on the platform, and some users will still view and be influenced by it. This will be seen as an insufficient response by those demanding complete removal. Conversely, the account holder and their followers will likely interpret the de-amplification and labeling as a form of covert censorship, thus not fully preventing the backlash that a full removal would create. The solution mitigates the worst potential outcomes rather than achieving an ideal one."
