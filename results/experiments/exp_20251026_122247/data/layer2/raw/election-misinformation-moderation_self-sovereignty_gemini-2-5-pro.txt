  "reasoning": "The core tension is between the platform's property rights, the creator's expressive autonomy, and the viewer's cognitive sovereignty. Removing the content treats adult users as incapable of critical thought, substituting the platform's judgment for their own and undermining individual agency. De-amplification is a non-transparent form of control that disrespects the user's ability to determine what is relevant. Taking no action abdicates the platform's right as a private property owner to set terms of use. The optimal solution is to provide more information, not less. Adding a warning label with a link to countervailing expert opinion respects the viewer's autonomy by empowering them to assess competing claims. It allows the original speech to stand, upholding the creator's right to express their interpretation, while simultaneously exercising the platform's property right to contextualize content on its own terms. This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty and the free marketplace of ideas over the collective welfare goal of preventing social discord or maintaining institutional trust through content suppression.",
  "recommendation": "Add a prominent warning label to the video. The label must state that the content's interpretation of technical documents is disputed by election officials and cybersecurity experts, and provide a direct link to the joint statement from CISA and state election directors. Do not remove the content or algorithmically de-amplify it.",

  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation deliberately accepts the risk that the video will continue to spread and persuade viewers, potentially undermining public confidence in elections and contributing to an environment where harassment of election workers occurs. The potential for collective harm and social instability is subordinated to the principle that individuals must be free to evaluate information, even if it is misleading, for themselves."
