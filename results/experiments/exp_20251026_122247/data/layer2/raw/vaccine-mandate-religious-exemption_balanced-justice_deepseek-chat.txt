  "reasoning": "1. Acknowledge established facts: The nurse has a strong employment record and pre-existing religious beliefs documented since 2019, while the COVID-19 vaccine is highly effective per FDA approval and studies, and there are immunocompromised students at risk. State law allows religious exemptions for other vaccines, but CDC guidance recommends vaccination for all staff. 2. Evaluate proportional response: Denying the exemption entirely would disproportionately infringe on the nurse's religious rights given their long service and documented beliefs, while granting it without conditions could pose significant health risks to vulnerable students. A proportional response balances these by not fully denying or granting the exemption but imposing accommodations. 3. Consider ripple effects: Granting exemption with accommodations protects individual rights and maintains the nurse's employment, while reducing but not eliminating health risks; this supports community health indirectly but may not fully align with CDC guidance. 4. Balance competing values: This reasoning balances individual rights (nurse's religious freedom and employment) with collective consequences (student safety and public health), prioritizing a middle ground that respects both without maximizing either. 5. State clearly: This reasoning balances religious freedom and personal agency with social responsibility and collective health outcomes.",
  "recommendation": "Grant the religious exemption but require accommodation measures, such as mandatory regular COVID-19 testing, use of high-grade personal protective equipment, and potential reassignment to roles with minimal student contact, to mitigate risks to immunocompromised students.",
  "valuesApplied": ["Individual rights and religious freedom", "Collective consequences and public health", "Proportional responses matching severity", "Balancing personal agency with social responsibility"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation compromises on ideal public health protection by not fully enforcing vaccination, potentially leaving immunocompromised students at some residual risk, and may incur additional costs for testing and accommodations, while not fully satisfying either the nurse's desire for no restrictions or the school's goal of maximum safety."
