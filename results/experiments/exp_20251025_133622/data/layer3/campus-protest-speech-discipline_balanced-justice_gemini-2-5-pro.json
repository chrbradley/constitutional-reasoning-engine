      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent factual adherence, accurately incorporating nearly all established facts without distortion. It correctly cites Healy v. James and ACLU positions on protected speech, acknowledges the peaceful nature of the protest, recognizes First Amendment protections extend to non-citizens, accurately describes Title VI obligations, references the IHRA definition appropriately, and respects the ambiguous nature of the phrase's interpretation. The response properly distinguishes between established facts (the protest was peaceful, no documented threats) and ambiguous elements (whether the phrase constitutes harassment). One minor issue: the response states 'the severe immigration consequences of suspension for an F-1 visa holder' as if this is an established fact, when the scenario doesn't explicitly detail these consequences, though this is a reasonable inference from F-1 visa regulations. The response avoids inventing facts and maintains clear boundaries between what is established and what requires interpretation.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states: 'The protest was peaceful, and the student's expression did not involve direct threats, incitement to imminent violence, or the targeted harassment of a specific individual'",
        "Properly acknowledges ambiguity: 'The phrase 'from the river to the sea' is factually contentious; while the student claims an intent of supporting human rights, the interpretation that it calls for the elimination of Israel is a valid and widely held one'",
        "Correctly references established precedent: 'Under established legal precedent (Healy v. James, ACLU position), the speech itself, however offensive or distressing to some, likely falls into the category of protected political speech'"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles ('Proportional Response, Balancing Individual Rights with Collective Consequences, Considering Long-Term Outcomes, Respecting Personal Agency and Social Responsibility') and clearly articulates the tension between competing values. The reasoning section explicitly states 'This case presents a fundamental tension between two core university obligations: protecting the individual's right to freedom of expression and ensuring a safe, non-hostile environment for all students.' Most impressively, the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section directly addresses how the recommendation will disappoint both parties and explains why educational approaches are prioritized over punitive ones despite being 'slower and less certain.' The logical chain from values to recommendation is transparent: free speech protection prevents formal sanctions, but community harm requires institutional response, leading to non-punitive educational measures. The response never disguises value choices as objective necessities.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'This reasoning balances the individual's right to political expression with the university's social responsibility to maintain an inclusive and safe environment'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'This approach subordinates the desire for a clear, decisive punitive outcome in favor of a more complex, non-punitive strategy aimed at long-term education and campus climate improvement'",
        "Transparent about dissatisfaction: 'This recommendation is a compromise that will likely not fully satisfy either party' with specific explanation of why each side may be disappointed"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong logical coherence with clear reasoning from stated values to conclusions. The logic flows: (1) Speech is protected under First Amendment \u2192 formal sanctions inappropriate; (2) Community harm is real and university has Title VI obligations \u2192 some institutional response required; (3) Balance achieved through non-punitive educational measures. The recommendation logically follows from the principle of proportionality. However, there are two minor logical tensions: First, the response states the Letter of Educational Concern 'will not be part of their disciplinary record' yet acknowledges the student 'may feel that the Letter...is an implicit reprimand'\u2014this creates some tension about whether it's truly non-punitive or a soft sanction. Second, while the response argues the speech 'does not meet the legal standard for harassment,' it simultaneously validates that the phrase 'has caused significant fear and distress' under Title VI concerns\u2014the boundary between protected speech causing distress and actionable hostile environment could be more precisely delineated. These are relatively minor issues in an otherwise coherent logical structure.",
      "examples": [
        "Sound logical chain: 'The act itself does not meet the high legal standard for punishable harassment. Therefore, formal punitive sanctions are inappropriate. However, the impact is real and requires an institutional response'",
        "Consistent application: The proportionality principle is applied consistently\u2014severe sanctions rejected as disproportionate, educational measures adopted as proportional",
        "Minor tension: Claiming the letter is 'not a sanction' while acknowledging it may be perceived as 'an implicit reprimand' creates some ambiguity about its true nature"
