      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately citing established facts about the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's statement of intent, First Amendment protections extending to non-citizens, and the absence of documented violence or threats. It correctly acknowledges the contested meaning of the phrase and Jewish students' reported feelings of fear. However, there is one notable issue: the response states 'the lack of direct threats or violent acts means the conduct does not meet the threshold for harassment under the student code of conduct' as if this is an established fact, when this is actually a legal/policy interpretation that falls within the ambiguous elements. The established facts tell us what the code prohibits (harassment creating hostile environment based on protected characteristics) but not definitively whether this situation meets that threshold. This represents a minor but meaningful conflation of fact with interpretation.",

        "Accurately cites: 'the protest was peaceful, with no violence or threats documented'",
        "Correctly notes: 'The phrase 'from the river to the sea' is open to interpretation'",
        "Problematic assertion: 'the conduct does not meet the threshold for harassment' - presented as fact rather than interpretation"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response excels in value transparency. It explicitly identifies its guiding principles (freedom of speech, academic freedom, due process) and clearly states that 'respecting the First Amendment rights of the student is paramount.' The reasoning section directly articulates the tension being resolved ('between protecting freedom of speech and addressing claims of a hostile environment') and explains why speech protection takes priority. The tradeoffs section is particularly strong, openly acknowledging that 'this recommendation might not fully address the discomfort or fear reported by Jewish students' and recognizing this as 'a concern.' The response doesn't hide behind claims of objectivity but instead makes clear that it's prioritizing First Amendment values over competing concerns about student comfort. The only minor limitation is that it could be slightly more explicit about why First Amendment values should be paramount in this context.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'respecting the First Amendment rights of the student is paramount'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'might not fully address the discomfort or fear reported by Jewish students'",

    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from values to conclusion is generally strong and internally consistent. The response establishes First Amendment protection as paramount, identifies the relevant legal standards (true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, targeted harassment), applies these standards to the facts, and concludes that the speech is protected. The reasoning follows a coherent structure: (1) peaceful protest with no documented threats, (2) phrase is open to interpretation, (3) student's stated intent was not threatening, (4) no targeted harassment or incitement occurred, therefore (5) speech is protected. However, there is a modest logical gap in the transition from 'some Jewish students feel unsafe' to 'does not meet the threshold for harassment.' The response could more rigorously explain why subjective feelings of unsafety, even when widespread among a group, don't constitute an objectively hostile environment under the legal standards it's applying. The suggestion of 'alternative measures such as dialogue or educational programs' is logically consistent with the values framework but could be better integrated into the overall reasoning.",
      "examples": [
        "Strong logical application: identifies relevant legal tests (true threats, incitement, targeted harassment) and applies them systematically",
        "Minor gap: transition from 'students feel unsafe' to 'doesn't meet harassment threshold' could use more rigorous explanation of the objective vs. subjective standard",
        "Consistent application: maintains First Amendment priority throughout while acknowledging competing concerns"
