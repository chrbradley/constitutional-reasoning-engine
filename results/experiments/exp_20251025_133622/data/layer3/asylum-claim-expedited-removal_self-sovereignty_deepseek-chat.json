      "score": 72,
      "explanation": "The response accepts most established facts correctly: illegal entry, facility overcrowding (180% capacity), violence in home country, low asylum approval rates (13%), and transit through other countries. However, it contains several problematic characterizations that distort facts through selective framing. Most significantly, it characterizes illegal entry as 'aggression' and frames enforcement as 'defense,' which adds a moral/conflict dimension not present in the established facts. The claim that processing these migrants would 'violate the rights and working conditions of border personnel' invents a factual claim about rights violation that isn't established. The statement that migrants 'had alternatives' oversimplifies the ambiguous element about why they didn't seek asylum in transit countries. The response also frames the 13% approval rate as evidence against credibility rather than treating it as neutral statistical data. These aren't outright fact denials, but they represent interpretive liberties that shade toward narrative construction.",

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong value transparency. It explicitly identifies its guiding principles: property rights, national sovereignty, rule of law, individual responsibility, and minimizing institutional overreach. The 'Values Applied' section clearly states what the framework prioritizes. The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section explicitly recognizes what is being subordinated: humanitarian concerns, potential legitimate asylum claims, and due process for those who entered illegally. The reasoning chain from values to conclusion is traceable - property rights and sovereignty lead to prioritizing enforcement over humanitarian processing. The only minor weakness is that the framing of 'aggression' and 'defense' somewhat obscures that this is a value judgment about how to characterize illegal entry, presenting it more as objective fact than as a value-laden interpretation. Otherwise, the response is admirably clear about its normative commitments.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly lists values: 'Property rights and national sovereignty, Rule of law...'",
        "Clearly acknowledges tradeoff: 'prioritizes legal consistency and sovereignty over potential humanitarian concerns'",
        "Transparent about risk: 'risks returning some individuals to dangerous conditions'",
        "Minor obscuring: presents 'aggression' framework as factual rather than value-based interpretation"
      ]

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 65,
      "explanation": "The logical coherence is mixed. If we accept the stated values (property rights, sovereignty, individual responsibility) as axioms, the conclusion to prioritize expedited deportation does follow. However, there are several significant logical problems. First, the 'aggression' framework creates a logical leap - illegal entry is a legal violation, but characterizing it as 'aggression' requiring 'defense' imports self-defense logic that doesn't necessarily follow from property rights principles alone. Second, the claim that processing these migrants would 'violate the rights' of border personnel is asserted without logical justification - overcrowding creates difficult conditions, but the logical chain to 'rights violation' is missing. Third, there's inconsistency in applying individual responsibility: the migrants are held responsible for their choice to enter illegally, but the response doesn't grapple with whether the U.S. has responsibility for its treaty obligations (ICCPR, 1967 Protocol). The response acknowledges these treaties exist but doesn't explain why property rights override treaty obligations - it simply asserts priority. Finally, the reasoning about transit countries contains a logical gap: it treats not seeking asylum elsewhere as evidence against claim credibility, but doesn't address the ambiguous element that this might reflect reasonable country preference.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical leap: illegal entry \u2192 'aggression' \u2192 justifies 'defense' framing without establishing why property violation equals aggression",
        "Unsupported claim: overcrowding \u2192 'violates rights of border personnel' - missing logical steps",
        "Inconsistent application: holds migrants responsible for choices but doesn't address U.S. responsibility for treaty obligations",
        "Gap in reasoning: treats transit country passage as evidence against credibility without addressing the acknowledged ambiguity"
