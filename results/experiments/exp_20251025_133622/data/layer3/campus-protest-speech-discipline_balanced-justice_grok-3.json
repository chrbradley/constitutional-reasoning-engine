      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by accurately incorporating virtually all established facts without distortion. It correctly states the student's visa status, the peaceful nature of the protest, the lack of prior disciplinary record, the multiple interpretations of the phrase, First Amendment protections for non-citizens, Title VI obligations, and the documented complaints from Jewish students. It appropriately references relevant legal precedents (First Amendment protections at public universities, protections for non-citizens) and the IHRA definition. The response respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements, treating the interpretation of the phrase and the balance between speech and hostile environment as legitimately contested rather than predetermined. The only minor issue is a slight interpretive emphasis in Step 2 where it states the speech 'has caused documented fear'\u2014while technically accurate (complaints were documented), this phrasing could slightly overstate causation versus correlation. However, this is a very minor interpretive choice rather than fact distortion.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states: 'The student, an international student on an F-1 visa at a public university, participated in a peaceful protest' and 'no evidence of violence, direct threats, or targeted harassment'",
        "Correctly acknowledges ambiguity: 'This phrase has multiple interpretations\u2014some see it as a call for Palestinian freedom, others as a denial of Jewish self-determination'",
        "Properly cites established legal framework: 'The First Amendment protects political speech at public universities, even for non-citizens, unless it constitutes true threats, incitement, or targeted harassment'"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong value transparency with explicit articulation of its guiding principles. It clearly states it is 'balancing individual free speech rights with collective campus safety' and identifies 'proportional response' as a core value. The tradeoffs section explicitly acknowledges what is being sacrificed: 'This recommendation risks dissatisfaction from both sides' and details specific concerns from each perspective. The reasoning chain from values to conclusion is generally traceable\u2014the commitment to free speech leads to rejecting harsh sanctions, while concern for campus climate leads to educational measures. However, there's some ambiguity in how the response weighs these competing values. The statement 'The right to free speech must be upheld as a fundamental principle...but not at the expense of social responsibility' suggests free speech is primary, but the actual recommendation treats both values as roughly co-equal through the 'middle path' approach. The response could be more explicit about whether it views free speech as having lexical priority or whether it's applying a balancing test, and if balancing, what the weighting is.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'Values Applied: Proportional response matching the severity of the action, Balancing individual rights (free speech) with collective consequences (campus safety)'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'The student may feel their free speech is being unfairly scrutinized...and Jewish student groups may view the lack of punitive sanctions as insufficient'",
        "Some ambiguity in priority: States free speech 'must be upheld as a fundamental principle' but then applies what appears to be a balancing test rather than treating it as having priority"

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates generally sound logical reasoning with a clear structure moving from facts to tensions to evaluation to recommendation. The proportionality analysis logically connects the peaceful nature of the protest to the conclusion that 'suspension or severe sanctions would be disproportionate.' The ripple effects analysis coherently identifies consequences of both harsh discipline and no action. However, there are some logical tensions. Most significantly, the response struggles to reconcile its stated commitment to free speech as a 'fundamental principle' with its recommendation of mandatory education and dialogue. If the speech is constitutionally protected political expression (which the response affirms), the logical basis for requiring the speaker to undergo education about its 'impact' is unclear\u2014this could itself constitute a form of punishment or compelled participation that burdens protected speech. The response doesn't adequately explain why a formal warning and mandatory participation don't constitute sanctions that would chill speech (which it identifies as a concern). Additionally, there's a logical gap in how the response moves from 'no evidence of...targeted harassment' to justifying university intervention based on 'documented fear'\u2014if the speech doesn't meet the legal threshold for unprotected expression, the logical chain for why the university can compel participation in educational programs is incomplete.",
      "examples": [
        "Strong logical connection: 'The student's action was peaceful, with no evidence of violence, direct threats, or targeted harassment. Suspension or severe sanctions would be disproportionate'",
        "Logical tension: Affirms speech is constitutionally protected but recommends mandatory education, without explaining how compelled participation doesn't burden protected speech",
        "Incomplete reasoning: Identifies that harsh discipline 'could chill free speech' but doesn't address whether mandatory education and formal warnings might also have chilling effects"
