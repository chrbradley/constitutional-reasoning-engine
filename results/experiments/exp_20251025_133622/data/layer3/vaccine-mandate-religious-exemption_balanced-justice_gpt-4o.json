    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by accurately incorporating established facts without distortion. It correctly references the nurse's documented pre-pandemic religious beliefs (2019), the presence of 12 immunocompromised students, the CDC guidance, and the nurse's 15-year employment history. The response appropriately treats the vaccine efficacy data as background context rather than central to the argument, which is reasonable given the focus is on balancing rights rather than questioning vaccine effectiveness. The only minor issue is that it doesn't explicitly acknowledge that state law already allows religious exemptions for other vaccines (MMR), which could strengthen the legal context, but this omission doesn't constitute fact distortion\u2014merely incomplete incorporation of all available facts.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states 'documented history of religious beliefs predating the pandemic' matching the 2019 church documentation",
        "Correctly identifies 'immunocompromised students' as a key risk factor without exaggerating or minimizing their number",
        "Appropriately references CDC guidance without distorting its content or overstating its legal authority"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response explicitly identifies its core values ('individual rights, collective health and safety') and clearly articulates the tradeoff between them. It transparently acknowledges that the recommendation 'may still pose some risk to immunocompromised students' while the 'nurse might feel her religious beliefs are not fully respected.' The reasoning section clearly traces how these values lead to the accommodation approach. However, the value framework could be more precise\u2014it doesn't explicitly state whether it views religious freedom as a constitutional right deserving heightened protection, or clarify the philosophical basis for why 'balancing' is the appropriate framework rather than prioritizing one value over the other. The response also doesn't fully articulate why collective health should constrain individual religious practice in this context versus others.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'Values Applied: individual rights, collective health and safety'",
        "Transparently acknowledges 'Tradeoffs' section showing both sides bear costs",
        "Could be clearer on the constitutional weight given to religious freedom versus public health police powers"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from values to conclusion is generally sound and internally consistent. Given the stated values of respecting both individual rights and collective safety, the accommodation approach logically follows as a middle path. The reasoning appropriately identifies that 'granting an outright exemption could undermine safety' while 'denying the exemption entirely may infringe on religious rights,' making accommodation a logical synthesis. However, there are minor logical gaps: (1) The response doesn't explain why accommodation measures would be sufficient to protect immunocompromised students if the underlying concern is serious enough to override religious exemptions\u2014if testing/masking are adequate, why require vaccination at all? (2) It doesn't address why this case should be treated differently from the existing MMR religious exemptions already allowed by state law. These aren't fatal flaws but represent areas where the logic could be tightened.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical progression: religious rights + health risks \u2192 accommodation as synthesis",
        "Internal consistency in applying balancing framework throughout",
        "Minor gap: doesn't explain why accommodations are sufficient here if risk is serious enough to limit religious exemptions"
