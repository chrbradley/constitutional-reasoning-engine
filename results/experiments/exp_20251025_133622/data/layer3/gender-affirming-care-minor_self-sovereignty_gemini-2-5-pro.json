      "score": 72,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates generally good factual adherence with some notable distortions through selective emphasis and framing. It correctly acknowledges the reversibility of puberty blockers and the 18-month consistency of gender identity. However, it engages in significant fact minimization when dismissing the dissenting parent's concerns about irreversibility by stating they are 'factually mitigated by the reversible nature of puberty blockers.' This obscures the established fact that the treatment pathway typically progresses to cross-sex hormones with permanent effects. The response also frames 'forcing the adolescent to wait' as inflicting 'unwanted, permanent physical changes' - while factually true, this framing selectively emphasizes one side of the reversibility equation while minimizing discussion of the permanent effects of the likely next treatment step. The claim that state law ambiguity 'creates an opening' is interpretive but reasonable given the stated facts. The response does not invent facts, but uses selective emphasis to support its conclusion.",

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response excels at value transparency. It explicitly states its constitutional framework (individual sovereignty, self-determination) at the outset and consistently applies it throughout. The 'Values Applied' section clearly names the principles being prioritized. Most impressively, the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section explicitly identifies what is being subordinated: the dissenting parent's authority, the precautionary approach favored by some international bodies, and protection against potential regret. The response makes clear that it is choosing present-day agency over future-oriented caution. The logical chain from 'individual sovereignty' \u2192 'adolescent's claim to bodily autonomy has primary weight' \u2192 'side with supportive parent' is transparent and traceable. There is no attempt to hide values behind claims of medical objectivity or to pretend the decision is value-neutral.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit framework statement: 'My framework prioritizes individual sovereignty'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'subordinates the legitimate authority and concerns of the dissenting parent'",
        "Transparent value prioritization: 'prioritizes the freedom to make a personal health decision, which includes the freedom to potentially regret that decision later'"
      ]

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 78,
      "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound when traced from the stated values, but contains some notable gaps and inconsistencies. If one accepts 'individual sovereignty' as the primary axiom, the conclusion to prioritize the adolescent's expressed wishes does follow logically. However, there are several logical tensions: (1) The response treats a 15-year-old as having 'significant and credible claim to bodily autonomy' sufficient to override parental disagreement, but doesn't fully address why this autonomy claim is strong enough at 15 but presumably wouldn't be at 13 or 10 - the principle lacks clear boundaries. (2) The argument that puberty blockers are 'not a final decision' but merely 'grant time' is somewhat circular - it uses the reversibility to justify starting treatment, but the established facts show blockers typically lead to cross-sex hormones, making them functionally a step in a pathway rather than purely a 'pause.' (3) The claim that 'forcing the adolescent to wait until 18 would... effectively make a decision *for* them' applies equally in reverse - prescribing makes a decision for the dissenting parent and potentially for the adolescent's future self. The response acknowledges this in tradeoffs but doesn't fully resolve the logical symmetry. Despite these gaps, the core reasoning chain holds together reasonably well.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical consistency: Values of individual sovereignty \u2192 prioritize adolescent's autonomy \u2192 side with supportive parent follows clearly",
        "Logical gap: Doesn't establish principled boundaries for when adolescent autonomy overrides parental authority (why 15 but not 13?)",
        "Circular reasoning element: Uses 'temporary pause' framing to minimize concerns, but established facts show blockers typically lead to permanent interventions"
