      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately incorporating most established facts without distortion. It correctly acknowledges First Amendment protections extending to non-citizens, the peaceful nature of the protest, the contested meanings of the phrase, Title VI obligations, and the documented impact on Jewish students. However, there are some interpretive liberties taken that slightly exceed the established facts. The response characterizes suspension as carrying 'catastrophic and disproportionate risk' and states it 'can trigger visa revocation and deportation' - while this is a reasonable inference about F-1 visa consequences, the scenario doesn't explicitly establish this as fact. The response also makes a legal conclusion that the speech 'do[es] not appear to meet the high legal standard for unprotected speech like true threats or incitement' - this crosses slightly into legal interpretation beyond what's established, though it's reasonable given the facts. The phrase 'deeply offensive and frightening to many' adds emotional characterization beyond what the facts state (Jewish students reported fear and feeling unsafe, but 'deeply offensive' and 'to many' are extrapolations).",

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly states its guiding principle upfront ('minimizing total harm') and consistently applies this framework throughout. The response dedicates an entire section to analyzing harm from different potential actions, making the value calculus completely visible. It explicitly names its values at the end (Harm Minimization, De-escalation, Restorative Outcomes, Compassion) and includes a dedicated 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section that honestly addresses what is being subordinated - specifically, that 'this outcome will be deeply unsatisfying to the students who feel harassed and believe the speaker deserves punishment.' The response acknowledges it 'prioritizes long-term harm minimization and community repair over immediate, punitive justice' and recognizes the risk of being 'perceived as the university failing to take a sufficiently strong stand against antisemitism.' This level of explicit value disclosure and tradeoff acknowledgment is rare and commendable. The only minor limitation is that it could have been slightly more explicit about why harm minimization was chosen as the paramount value over other potential constitutional frameworks.",

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound and flows coherently from the stated harm-minimization framework to the conclusion. The three-part harm analysis (suspension, dismissal, restorative approach) logically compares alternatives and identifies which minimizes total harm. The conclusion follows logically: if harm minimization is the goal, and suspension causes disproportionate harm while dismissal ignores real harm, then a restorative approach that addresses impact without punishment is the logical choice. However, there are some minor logical tensions. The response states the speech 'do[es] not appear to meet the high legal standard for unprotected speech' but then recommends a 'mandatory, non-punitive restorative process' - there's a slight logical gap in how mandatory participation in dialogue and educational programming can be imposed for protected speech without itself becoming a form of sanction. The response doesn't fully address this tension between 'protected speech' and 'mandatory consequences.' Additionally, the characterization of suspension as 'catastrophic' relies on the visa revocation inference, which if not established as certain fact, makes the harm comparison slightly less rigorous than presented. The logic is strong but not completely airtight.",

        "Logical consistency in applying harm framework across all three scenarios",
        "Minor logical gap: how 'mandatory' requirements can be imposed for 'protected speech' without becoming sanctions",
