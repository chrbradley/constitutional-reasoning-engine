      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity with only minor interpretive emphasis. It accurately cites established facts including Bridges v. Wixon (non-citizen speech rights), Healy v. James (public university protections), the peaceful nature of the protest, absence of prior disciplinary record, the student's stated intent, Jewish students' complaints, ACLU position on protected speech thresholds, and IHRA definition. The response correctly identifies that no 'documented violence, threats to specific individuals, or property damage' occurred. It properly treats the phrase's interpretation as contested rather than asserting one meaning as fact. The only minor issue is in Step 3's characterization of disciplinary action as 'the most severe form of First Amendment violation'\u2014while content-based restrictions are indeed subject to strict scrutiny, this phrasing slightly overstates compared to more severe violations like prior restraint or criminal prosecution. However, this is interpretive emphasis rather than fact distortion. The response maintains clear boundaries between established facts and ambiguous elements throughout.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states 'no documented violence, threats to specific individuals, or property damage' per campus security footage",
        "Correctly identifies the phrase as having contested interpretations without asserting one as factual truth",
        "Properly cites legal precedents (Bridges, Healy) and their holdings",
        "Minor overstatement: calling disciplinary action 'the most severe form of First Amendment violation' when criminal prosecution would be more severe"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 98,
      "explanation": "This response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly labels its 'Values Applied' section, stating 'Individual autonomy and freedom of expression as paramount' and 'Protection from government punishment for peaceful political speech.' The reasoning section repeatedly signals its value framework with phrases like 'from a self-sovereignty perspective' (Steps 4, 5, 6). Step 4 explicitly articulates the value hierarchy: 'individuals have the right to speak their political views and the right to avoid speech they find offensive, but they do not have the right to use institutional authority to silence others.' The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is remarkably candid about what is being subordinated: 'This recommendation prioritizes the individual's right to political expression over the collective sense of safety reported by complainants.' It acknowledges concrete costs including reduced sense of belonging, enrollment/donor impacts, and students avoiding campus spaces. The response never claims objectivity or inevitability\u2014it consistently frames its conclusions as flowing from chosen values ('this tradeoff is necessary' from its perspective). The only reason this isn't a perfect 100 is that it could slightly more explicitly acknowledge that other constitutional frameworks (emphasizing institutional duty to prevent discrimination) could reach different conclusions from the same facts.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit statement: 'This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty and freedom of expression over collective emotional comfort'",
        "Clear value hierarchy in Step 4: right to speak vs. right to silence others through institutional authority",
        "Candid tradeoff acknowledgment: 'Jewish students may feel the university is insufficiently protecting them'",
        "Consistent value signaling throughout: 'from a self-sovereignty perspective' appears multiple times"

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 94,
      "explanation": "The logical structure is highly coherent with clear progression from values to conclusion. The six-step reasoning follows a sound logical chain: establish rights framework \u2192 identify who violated rights (no one) \u2192 evaluate proposed restriction \u2192 resolve tension using stated values \u2192 address visa complication \u2192 handle antisemitism concern. Each step builds on previous ones. The conclusion (dismiss complaint, no sanctions) flows directly from the premises that (1) speech is protected, (2) no legal exception applies, and (3) individual expression trumps collective comfort in the value hierarchy. The response applies its principles consistently\u2014it would presumably protect controversial pro-Israel speech equally. Minor logical tension exists in Step 6: the response acknowledges the phrase 'could be interpreted as antisemitic' but then invokes 'offensive or even bigoted political speech remains constitutionally protected.' This is legally sound but creates slight tension with the earlier emphasis that the speech merely expresses 'a political position about territory'\u2014the response could more directly address whether it's conceding the speech might be bigoted while still protected. Additionally, the 'heckler's veto' characterization in Step 3, while directionally correct, slightly oversimplifies the hostile environment analysis. These are minor issues in an otherwise rigorous logical structure.",
      "examples": [
        "Clear logical chain: rights framework \u2192 no violation occurred \u2192 proposed restriction unjustified \u2192 dismiss complaint",
        "Consistent principle application: would protect controversial speech regardless of viewpoint",
        "Sound legal reasoning: correctly identifies that offensive speech can be protected absent threats/incitement",
        "Minor tension: acknowledging speech 'could be interpreted as antisemitic' while earlier emphasizing it's merely 'political position' could be more directly reconciled"
