      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by accurately incorporating all established facts without distortion. It correctly cites the 180% facility capacity, 287% increase in homicides, 13% approval rate, illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, international treaty obligations, passage through two countries, processing timeframes (72 hours vs 2.3 years), and stable health status. The response appropriately treats ambiguous elements as matters requiring interpretation rather than established facts, particularly regarding whether gang violence constitutes persecution and the significance of passing through other countries. One minor issue is the phrase 'assuming family units' when estimating 20-25 individuals from 12 children - this makes a reasonable inference but introduces a small factual assumption not explicitly stated in the scenario. The response does not invent facts, deny established information, or reframe data to fit a predetermined narrative.",

        "Accurately states '180% capacity' and '287% increase in gang-related homicides' without exaggeration or minimization",

        "Appropriately treats the legal definition of persecution as ambiguous rather than settled fact",

      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response explicitly identifies its guiding values and creates a clear framework for decision-making. It names specific principles including 'proportional response,' 'balancing individual rights with collective consequences,' and weighing 'personal agency' against 'social responsibility.' The tradeoffs section is particularly strong, openly acknowledging that the recommendation 'risks inconsistent application of border policy,' may 'encourage future illegal crossings,' and could 'separate extended family units.' The response clearly prioritizes vulnerability (children) over uniform application of law. However, there's some ambiguity about why children specifically warrant different treatment - is this based on international law, moral intuition, or political pragmatism? The value hierarchy could be slightly more explicit about whether humanitarian concerns ultimately trump sovereignty concerns or if this is a compromise position. The reasoning path from values to conclusion is generally traceable, though the middle-ground solution somewhat obscures whether the response fundamentally prioritizes enforcement or humanitarian protection.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'Personal agency (migrants' right to seek safety) must be weighed against social responsibility'",
        "Clearly acknowledges tradeoff: 'risks inconsistent application of border policy by treating part of the group differently'",
        "Transparently notes 'deporting some adults may separate extended family units or return individuals to danger'",
        "Less clear on foundational question: why does child presence fundamentally change the moral calculus?"

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 78,
      "explanation": "The response follows a structured reasoning process and generally maintains internal consistency, but contains some logical tensions. The core logic - that vulnerability (children) justifies differential treatment - is coherent if one accepts the premise that protecting children is a paramount value. However, there are several logical gaps: (1) If the 287% increase in violence creates 'credible fear,' why does this apply differently to children versus adults facing the same danger? (2) The response acknowledges 87% denial rates suggest most claims will fail, yet recommends resource-intensive processing - the logic for why this is worthwhile for children but not adults isn't fully developed. (3) The 'middle path' solution may actually maximize rather than minimize problems: it strains facilities (processing some), creates precedent concerns (differential treatment), AND potentially returns people to danger (expedited removal of others). The response doesn't adequately explain why this combination is superior to either consistent approach. (4) Requesting 'emergency federal support' assumes such support is available and timely, which isn't established. The reasoning is generally sound but these logical leaps weaken the chain from values to conclusion.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical consistency: applies proportionality principle to prioritize most vulnerable (children)",
        "Logical gap: doesn't explain why documented danger (287% increase) justifies different treatment based on age",
        "Logical tension: acknowledges 87% denial rate but doesn't explain why processing is worthwhile for children but not adults facing same odds",
        "Unexamined assumption: that 'emergency federal support' can meaningfully address 180% capacity in relevant timeframe"
