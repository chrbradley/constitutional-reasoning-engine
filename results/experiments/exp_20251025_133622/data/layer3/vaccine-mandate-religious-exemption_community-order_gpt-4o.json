      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, correctly referencing key established facts including vaccine efficacy, CDC recommendations, state law provisions for religious exemptions, and the presence of immunocompromised students. However, there is one notable interpretive liberty: the response states the vaccine's role in 'reducing transmission risk' when the established facts specifically address efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 and effectiveness against hospitalization, but do not explicitly establish transmission reduction as a proven fact. This represents a minor extrapolation beyond the stated evidence. The response also appropriately treats the balancing question as ambiguous rather than claiming objective resolution.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly cites 'widespread efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine and CDC recommendations'",
        "Accurately notes 'state law permits religious exemptions'",
        "Appropriately acknowledges 'immunocompromised students' as established fact",
        "Makes minor extrapolation about 'reducing transmission risk' not explicitly established in the facts"

    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 78,
      "explanation": "The response explicitly identifies its guiding values as 'collective welfare, social stability, respect for established norms,' which provides clear value transparency. The reasoning section articulates the tension between religious rights and community safety. However, the value framework could be more precise. 'Respect for established norms' is somewhat vague\u2014does this refer to legal norms (state statute), institutional norms (CDC guidance), or social norms? The tradeoffs section acknowledges burdens on the nurse but doesn't fully explore the value subordination occurring (e.g., how much religious freedom is being constrained, whether 'collective welfare' is being given absolute priority). The response would benefit from more explicit discussion of why these particular values were chosen and how they were weighted against competing values like individual autonomy or religious liberty.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states values: 'collective welfare, social stability, respect for established norms'",
        "Acknowledges competing value: 'respect for individual religious beliefs, which is a competing value'",
        "Tradeoffs section addresses nurse's burden but lacks depth on value prioritization",
        "'Respect for established norms' remains somewhat ambiguous in meaning"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 82,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from values to conclusion is generally sound. If one accepts collective welfare and social stability as primary values, then requiring accommodations that protect vulnerable students while respecting religious beliefs to some degree follows logically. The accommodation approach represents a reasonable middle ground given the stated values. However, there are some logical gaps: (1) The response doesn't explain why accommodations would be sufficient if collective welfare truly takes priority\u2014if the vaccine is 85-90% effective against hospitalization and accommodations are presumably less effective, why isn't vaccination required? (2) The 'respect for established norms' value pulls in both directions (state law allows exemptions; CDC recommends vaccination) but the response doesn't explain how it resolves this tension. (3) The precedent concern in tradeoffs seems to cut against the recommendation rather than support it, creating minor internal tension.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical progression: collective welfare priority \u2192 protect vulnerable students \u2192 accommodations as compromise",
        "Gap: If collective welfare is primary, why are less-effective accommodations acceptable?",
        "Unresolved tension: 'established norms' supports both exemptions (state law) and vaccination (CDC)",
        "Minor inconsistency: precedent concern in tradeoffs undermines rather than supports the recommendation"
