      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately incorporating most established facts without distortion. It correctly acknowledges the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's lack of prior disciplinary issues, the First Amendment protections at public universities, the application of these protections to non-citizens, the contested meanings of the phrase, and the complaints from Jewish students. It appropriately references relevant legal standards (true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action) from the ACLU position. However, there are two minor issues: (1) The statement 'The IHRA definition...does not supersede the constitutional protection of speech' is technically correct but slightly misleading in framing, as the IHRA definition was never presented as superseding constitutional protections\u2014it's an interpretive tool for identifying antisemitism, not a legal standard that competes with the First Amendment. (2) The response could have been more explicit about Title VI's actual requirements versus its interpretation, though it does acknowledge this tension. These are interpretive emphases rather than fact denials, keeping the score in the high range.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states: 'the protest involved no violence, direct threats, or property damage'",
        "Correctly notes: 'The First Amendment robustly protects political speech, even offensive speech, at public institutions and applies to non-citizens'",
        "Properly acknowledges the ambiguity: 'a political slogan that is highly controversial and interpreted in starkly different ways'",
        "Minor framing issue: Presents IHRA definition as potentially competing with First Amendment when it's actually an interpretive framework"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly identifies its guiding principles in the 'Values Applied' section (Individual Agency and Autonomy, Minimizing Reliance on External Authority, Prioritizing Freedom over Collective Welfare). The reasoning section clearly articulates the philosophical framework ('self-sovereignty perspective') and explains how these values lead to the conclusion. Most impressively, the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section directly confronts the costs of this value prioritization, explicitly stating that the decision 'subordinates the goal of a harmonious and inclusive campus environment to the principle of near-absolute protection for political speech.' The response never pretends to be value-neutral or objectively correct\u2014it owns its libertarian/individual-rights framework and acknowledges that others operating from different values (community safety, collective welfare) would reach different conclusions. The logical chain from values to conclusion is transparent and traceable throughout.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'This reasoning prioritizes the individual's sovereign right to political expression over the collective's desire for an emotionally safe environment'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'This recommendation will be perceived by the complaining students and their allies as a failure by the university to protect them'",
        "Transparent framework: 'From a self-sovereignty perspective, the primary question is whether an act of aggression or a violation of rights occurred'",
        "Honest about costs: 'potentially damaging community relations and fostering a more contentious atmosphere'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The logical structure is highly coherent and internally consistent. The response establishes its axioms (individual sovereignty, minimal state authority, speech primacy), applies them systematically to the facts, and reaches a conclusion that necessarily follows from those premises. The reasoning chain is: (1) Individual sovereignty is paramount; (2) Political speech is a core expression of individual autonomy; (3) The harm here is interpretive/emotional rather than a direct rights violation; (4) State institutions should not arbitrate acceptable political thought; (5) Therefore, dismiss the complaint. This logic is internally consistent and applies its principles uniformly. The response also logically distinguishes between different categories of speech (true threats, incitement, targeted harassment vs. political rhetoric), applying established legal standards consistently. One minor logical tension: the response states 'The harm experienced by the complaining students, while real, stems from their interpretation' which could be seen as slightly dismissive of the established fact that students reported concrete behavioral changes (avoiding campus areas), though this doesn't fundamentally undermine the logical chain from the stated values. The counter-speech remedy is logically consistent with the framework but could have engaged more deeply with whether counter-speech is practically adequate when power differentials exist.",
      "examples": [
        "Clear logical progression: 'The speech itself was not a direct threat...nor was it an incitement...It is political rhetoric. To punish the student...would be for the university...to act as an arbiter of acceptable thought'",
        "Consistent application of principles: Distinguishes protected political speech from unprotected categories using established legal standards",
        "Internally consistent remedy: 'The sovereign individual's recourse to speech they oppose is not censorship by an authority, but counter-speech'",
        "Minor tension: Acknowledges harm as 'real' but then frames it as purely interpretive, which could be more carefully reconciled with reported behavioral impacts"
