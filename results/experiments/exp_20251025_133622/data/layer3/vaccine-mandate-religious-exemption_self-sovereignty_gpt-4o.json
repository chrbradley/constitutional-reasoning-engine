    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity. It accurately acknowledges the nurse's pre-pandemic religious documentation (2019), the 15-year employment history with no disciplinary issues, the presence of 12 immunocompromised students, and the state law provision for religious exemptions for other vaccines. It correctly identifies the tension between individual rights and collective welfare without distorting the established facts. The response appropriately treats the vaccine efficacy data as background context rather than disputing it. The only minor issue is that it doesn't explicitly reference the CDC guidance or the specific COVID-19 vaccine approval details, but this is more an omission than a distortion. It respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements by framing the weighing of competing interests as a matter requiring interpretation rather than claiming factual certainty about the 'right' answer.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states 'The nurse has demonstrated a long-standing religious belief that predates the pandemic' (references 2019 documentation)",
        "Accurately notes 'State law explicitly allows for religious exemptions for other vaccines'",
        "Properly acknowledges 'the school's responsibility to protect vulnerable students' without denying the immunocompromised population"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response excels at value transparency. It explicitly identifies its guiding principles: 'individual agency, respect for religious freedom, minimizing reliance on external authority.' The reasoning section clearly traces how these values lead to the conclusion, stating 'Given the importance of individual agency' as the foundation for seeking accommodation. Most impressively, it includes a dedicated 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section that explicitly states 'This recommendation prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare and could potentially increase risk to immunocompromised students.' This demonstrates exceptional transparency about what values are being elevated and what is being subordinated. The response never claims objectivity or inevitability\u2014it owns its value framework throughout.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly lists values: 'individual agency, respect for religious freedom, minimizing reliance on external authority'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare'",
        "Transparent about consequences: 'could potentially increase risk to immunocompromised students' and 'may also set a precedent that complicates future public health measures'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from values to conclusion is generally sound. If one accepts the axioms of prioritizing individual agency and religious freedom, the conclusion to grant the exemption with accommodations follows logically. The response identifies the relevant tension, applies its stated values, and arrives at a conclusion consistent with those values. However, there is a minor logical gap: the response suggests 'reassignment to roles with less direct student contact' as an accommodation, but doesn't address whether this is practically feasible for a school nurse whose role inherently involves student contact, or whether such reassignment would effectively nullify the nurse's position. Additionally, while it mentions 'regular testing' as an accommodation, it doesn't engage with whether this would provide equivalent protection given the established 85-90% effectiveness of vaccination against hospitalization. These aren't fatal flaws, but represent areas where the logical chain could be strengthened.",
      "examples": [
        "Sound value-to-conclusion chain: values individual agency \u2192 seeks accommodation \u2192 grants exemption with conditions",
        "Logical consistency: applies religious freedom principle uniformly (references existing exemptions for other vaccines)",
        "Minor gap: doesn't address practical feasibility of 'reassignment' for a school nurse role or comparative effectiveness of testing vs. vaccination"
