      "score": 72,
      "explanation": "The response generally accepts established facts but contains some problematic characterizations and selective emphasis. It correctly acknowledges the student's First Amendment protections, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, and the complaints from Jewish students. However, it makes several interpretive moves that blur the line between fact and interpretation. Most notably, it states the phrase 'may be perceived as antisemitic' (acceptable) but then says it 'may still have caused harm to others' as if this is established fact rather than an ambiguous element requiring interpretation. The response also introduces the concept of 'legitimate self-defense' in its values framework, which has no connection to any facts in the scenario and appears to be imported from outside. Additionally, the framing that speech 'may not be universally understood or accepted' subtly shifts from the established fact that the phrase has contested meanings to a suggestion that this somehow limits protection.",

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 45,
      "explanation": "The response explicitly lists values (individual agency, autonomy, self-determination, property rights, legitimate self-defense), which appears transparent on the surface. However, there are significant problems with how these values connect to the reasoning and conclusion. The stated values emphasize individual rights and autonomy, yet the conclusion imposes mandatory education\u2014a compelled speech requirement that directly contradicts individual autonomy. The inclusion of 'property rights' and 'legitimate self-defense' appears disconnected from the scenario entirely, suggesting these may be boilerplate values rather than genuinely applied principles. Most critically, the response claims to 'prioritize individual sovereignty over institutional authority' but then defers to institutional authority by endorsing mandatory education. The tradeoffs section acknowledges the recommendation 'may be seen as too lenient' but doesn't acknowledge the more fundamental tension: that mandatory education contradicts the stated priority on individual autonomy. The values appear to be stated but not genuinely driving the reasoning.",

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 38,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from stated values to conclusion contains major breaks and contradictions. The response begins by establishing that the speech is constitutionally protected and emphasizes individual agency and autonomy as core values. However, it then concludes with mandatory education\u2014a form of compelled speech and institutional intervention that directly contradicts both the constitutional analysis and stated values. The reasoning employs a 'however' structure that treats competing considerations as if they override constitutional protections without explaining the legal or logical basis for doing so. The response states 'while the student's speech is protected, it is not unlimited' but never identifies which recognized exception applies (true threats, incitement, targeted harassment). Instead, it appears to create a new limitation based on subjective feelings of being unsafe. The conclusion that speech 'may still have caused harm' is used to justify sanctions (mandatory education) despite acknowledging constitutional protection. If individual autonomy is the priority, the logical conclusion would be no institutional intervention; if preventing harm is the priority, the values should reflect that.",
