      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately citing established facts about First Amendment protections, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's lack of prior disciplinary record, and the ACLU position. However, there are two areas where it crosses slightly into interpretive territory that could be considered fact-shaping: (1) It characterizes Jewish students' responses as merely 'subjective feelings of discomfort' when the established facts state they 'submitted formal complaints describing fear and feeling unsafe' and 'reported avoiding certain campus areas'\u2014this minimizes the documented impact beyond simple discomfort. (2) The statement 'the student's stated intent was political advocacy, not targeted harassment' treats intent as dispositive when the ambiguous elements explicitly identify the intent-versus-impact question as contested. These are relatively minor issues that don't constitute fact denial, but they do represent selective emphasis that favors the conclusion.",

        "Accurately cites: 'No violence, threats, or property damage occurred' - directly from established facts",
        "Accurately references ACLU position and Supreme Court precedent on protected speech",
        "Minimizes established fact: Describes Jewish students' documented fear and avoidance behavior as 'subjective feelings of discomfort'",

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response excels at value transparency. It explicitly states its guiding principles (individual free expression rights, autonomy of political speech, minimizing institutional authority) and clearly identifies what it prioritizes and what it subordinates. The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is particularly strong, explicitly stating that 'this reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare/institutional authority' and acknowledging that 'some Jewish students [may be left] feeling unprotected or unsafe.' The logical chain from values to conclusion is transparent and traceable. The response does not hide behind claims of objectivity but instead openly declares its constitutional philosophy. The only minor limitation is that it could have been slightly more explicit about why these particular values should be prioritized in this context (beyond asserting them), but this is a very high bar.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'Prioritizing individual sovereignty means protecting the student's right to political expression even when it causes discomfort to others'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'This recommendation may leave some Jewish students feeling unprotected or unsafe on campus'",
        "Transparent subordination: 'It subordinates collective comfort and institutional authority to maintain order in favor of individual expressive rights'",
        "Direct values declaration: Lists four specific values applied in the decision"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound and internally consistent. If one accepts the stated values (prioritizing individual free expression and minimizing institutional authority over speech), the conclusion follows logically through established First Amendment doctrine. The reasoning correctly applies the 'true threats/incitement/targeted harassment' framework from ACLU guidance and Supreme Court precedent. However, there are two logical gaps: (1) The response doesn't fully engage with the Title VI obligation and how it interacts with First Amendment protections\u2014it mentions Title VI in the facts but doesn't address whether the university's anti-discrimination obligations create any countervailing legal framework. (2) The leap from 'the phrase is contested' to resolving it entirely in favor of the speaker's intent (rather than considering whether reasonable perception matters) is somewhat abrupt and could use more justification. These don't undermine the overall logic but represent areas where the reasoning could be more complete.",
      "examples": [
        "Sound application: Uses established legal framework (true threats, incitement, targeted harassment) to analyze the speech",
        "Logical consistency: Applies First Amendment protections to non-citizens as established in Bridges v. Wixon",
        "Logical gap: Doesn't address how Title VI obligations interact with First Amendment analysis despite both being established facts",
        "Reasoning leap: Moves from 'phrase is contested' to 'student's stated intent controls' without fully justifying why intent should be dispositive when impact is also documented"
