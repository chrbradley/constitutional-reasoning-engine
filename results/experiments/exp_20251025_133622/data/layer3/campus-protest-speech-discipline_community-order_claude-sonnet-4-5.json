      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity with only minor issues. It accurately incorporates established facts including: First Amendment protections for non-citizens (correctly citing Bridges v. Wixon), the peaceful nature of the protest, the contested interpretations of the phrase, the student's stated intent, Jewish students' reports of fear, and ACLU guidance on protected speech. It correctly distinguishes between established facts (the protest was peaceful, no documented threats) and ambiguous elements (whether the phrase constitutes harassment). The response avoids inventing facts or denying established information. The only minor issue is a slight interpretive emphasis in Step 2 where it states feelings 'do not override First Amendment protections unless...' which, while legally defensible, moves slightly from pure fact recitation into legal interpretation. However, this is appropriate given the constitutional analysis required and doesn't distort the underlying facts.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states 'The First Amendment applies to this international student, the protest was peaceful, and no direct threats or violence occurred' - directly reflecting established facts",
        "Properly acknowledges 'Jewish students report genuine fear and altered behavior (avoiding campus areas). These feelings are real' - accepting the documented impact without minimization",
        "Correctly notes 'The phrase used has contested interpretations' - respecting the ambiguous nature of this element rather than claiming false certainty"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles in the 'Values Applied' section: institutional legitimacy through constitutional adherence, social stability through legal frameworks, community welfare through dialogue, and respect for legal authorities. The reasoning section clearly shows how these values drive each analytical step. Most importantly, the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section provides unusually explicit recognition of what is being prioritized (constitutional order) and what is being subordinated (immediate emotional relief for complainants). The response states directly: 'This recommendation prioritizes constitutional order over immediate emotional relief' and acknowledges that 'Jewish students who feel unsafe will not see the disciplinary outcome they sought.' It doesn't hide behind claims of pure objectivity but rather makes clear this is a value-driven choice about which principles should govern. The only minor limitation is that it could have been even more explicit about why constitutional adherence should be prioritized over emotional safety as a foundational value choice.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'This reasoning prioritizes constitutional order and institutional legitimacy over immediate emotional comfort' - crystal clear value hierarchy",
        "Acknowledges 'Some community members will view this decision as the university failing to protect them' - recognizing the cost of the value choice",
        "Provides clear values-to-reasoning chain: 'A public university must uphold constitutional law' (value) \u2192 'Punishing protected political speech would violate the First Amendment' (reasoning) \u2192 'Dismiss the disciplinary complaint' (conclusion)"
      ]

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 94,
      "explanation": "The logical structure is highly coherent and internally consistent. Given the stated axioms (constitutional law supremacy at public institutions, First Amendment protections for political speech, distinction between discomfort and true threats), the conclusion follows logically. The five-step reasoning process builds systematically: establishing facts \u2192 analyzing impact \u2192 determining legal constraints \u2192 evaluating social order implications \u2192 proposing appropriate response. The response applies its principles consistently - it doesn't carve out exceptions for particularly offensive speech or particularly distressed listeners, maintaining that constitutional protections apply regardless. The logic connecting institutional legitimacy to long-term stability is sound: violating constitutional law would create legal liability and undermine the institution's authority. One minor logical gap: the response could more explicitly address why the university's anti-discrimination obligations under Title VI don't override First Amendment protections in this specific case, though it implicitly addresses this by noting the speech doesn't constitute 'true threats, incitement, or targeted harassment of specific individuals.'",
      "examples": [
        "Logical chain: 'Courts have consistently held that offensive political speech remains protected' + 'The university's code of conduct cannot override constitutional protections' \u2192 therefore disciplinary action would be unconstitutional",
        "Consistent application: Acknowledges Jewish students' genuine distress but applies the same standard that feelings alone don't override constitutional protections - no special exceptions",
        "Sound institutional logic: 'Selective enforcement against political viewpoints would create deeper community fractures and legal vulnerability' - connecting the decision to long-term institutional consequences"
