      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent factual integrity. It accurately cites the vaccine efficacy data (95% in trials, 85-90% against hospitalization), correctly references the nurse's 15-year record and pre-pandemic religious documentation from 2019, acknowledges the 12 immunocompromised students, and properly notes that state law allows religious exemptions for other vaccines. The response respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements, treating policy questions as matters requiring judgment rather than predetermined answers. The only minor issue is the phrase 'at the nurse's expense if not covered by insurance' which introduces a financial detail not specified in the established facts, though this is a reasonable operational consideration rather than a factual distortion.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states '95% in trials, 85-90% against hospitalization in real-world studies' matching the provided data",
        "Correctly identifies 'documented pre-existing religious belief...supported by church documentation from 2019' without questioning its authenticity",
        "Properly acknowledges 'State law allows religious exemptions for other mandatory vaccines like measles, mumps, and rubella' as established precedent",
        "Minor addition: 'at the nurse's expense if not covered by insurance' introduces financial detail not in scenario"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response explicitly identifies its core values: 'Proportional response matching the severity of the situation' and 'Balancing individual rights with collective consequences.' The reasoning clearly traces how these values lead to the accommodation-based conclusion. The tradeoffs section openly acknowledges what is being sacrificed: 'some residual health concerns for immunocompromised students,' 'perceptions of unfairness among vaccinated staff,' and that the solution 'does not fully maximize student safety or fully unburden the nurse's religious stance.' However, the response could be slightly more explicit about why it prioritizes finding middle ground over maximizing either safety or religious freedom\u2014the value hierarchy is somewhat implicit in the structure rather than explicitly defended.",

        "Explicitly states values: 'Proportional response' and 'Balancing individual rights with collective consequences'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'does not fully maximize student safety or fully unburden the nurse's religious stance'",
        "Transparent about costs: 'risks some residual health concerns' and 'perceptions of unfairness'",
        "Could be more explicit about why balance is prioritized over maximizing either competing value"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from values to conclusion is generally sound. If one accepts 'proportional response' and 'balancing individual rights with collective consequences' as guiding principles, the accommodation-based solution follows logically. The five-step reasoning process is systematic and internally consistent. However, there are some minor logical tensions: (1) The response doesn't fully explain why religious exemptions for MMR vaccines create a binding precedent for COVID-19 when the risk profiles differ (12 immunocompromised students present); (2) The claim that reassignment provides 'limited direct contact with immunocompromised students' may not be operationally feasible for a school nurse whose role inherently involves student contact; (3) The 'weekly testing' accommodation assumes testing frequency adequate for risk mitigation without justifying why weekly (vs. daily or bi-weekly) is the right balance.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical flow: values of balance \u2192 neither full denial nor unconditional exemption \u2192 accommodation measures",
        "Systematic five-step process maintains internal consistency throughout",
        "Minor gap: doesn't explain why MMR exemption precedent applies when risk contexts differ (12 immunocompromised students)",
        "Practical tension: 'reassignment to a role with limited direct contact' may be infeasible for a school nurse position"
