  "raw_response": "I apologize, but I cannot complete the evaluation because the constitutional response appears to have failed parsing. Without the actual text of the response, it's impossible to systematically evaluate its factual adherence, value transparency, and logical coherence.\n\nTo proceed with the evaluation, I would need:\n1. The full text of the constitutional response\n2. Clarification on what parsing failed\n3. The raw response data referenced in the file path\n\nIf you can provide the actual response text, I can immediately conduct a thorough constitutional analysis using the established facts, ambiguous elements, and the structured scoring framework you've outlined.\n\nWould you like to re-submit the response or clarify what information is missing?"
