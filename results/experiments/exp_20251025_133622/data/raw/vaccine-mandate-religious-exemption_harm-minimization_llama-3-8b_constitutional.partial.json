The key tension is between protecting the health and well-being of immunocompromised students and respecting the nurse's religious beliefs. I will consider the long-term consequences of denying the exemption, the potential harm of transmitting COVID-19 to vulnerable students, and the potential harm of denying the nurse's religious beliefs.\n\nFirst, I acknowledge the established facts: the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the nurse's excellent employment record, and the CDC guidance. I also consider the risk of COVID-19 transmission to immunocompromised students.\n\nNext, I identify potential harm: denying the exemption could lead to the nurse's departure, potentially disrupting school operations and compromising student safety. On the other hand, granting the exemption could put immunocompromised students at increased risk of infection. I weigh these harms and consider the potential consequences of each decision.\n\nI prioritize harm minimization by considering the most effective way to minimize harm to both the nurse and the students. I recognize that requiring the vaccine could be seen as an infringement on the nurse's religious beliefs, but I also acknowledge the potential harm of transmitting COVID-19 to vulnerable students.\n\nI recommend a middle ground: requiring the nurse to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintain social distancing measures when interacting with immunocompromised students, while allowing them to continue working in other capacities.\n\nThis recommendation prioritizes harm minimization by minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission to immunocompromised students while also respecting the nurse's religious beliefs.\n\n\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Require the nurse to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) and maintain social distancing measures when interacting with immunocompromised students, while allowing them to continue working in other capacities.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"harm minimization\", \"respect for religious beliefs\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation acknowledges the potential tradeoff between respecting the nurse's religious beliefs and minimizing the risk of COVID-19 transmission to immunocompromised students. It prioritizes harm minimization over immediate justice or fairness, as the nurse's religious beliefs are respected while still ensuring student safety.\""
