  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion. The migrants entered illegally, facilities are severely overcrowded, their country has documented violence increases, but their asylum claims have low historical approval rates and they passed through other countries without seeking protection. Step 2: Consider community impact. Expedited deportation upholds immigration laws and prevents further strain on overwhelmed facilities, maintaining institutional functionality. Asylum processing would further burden the system, potentially compromising care for all detainees and undermining border security norms. Step 3: Evaluate institutional roles. Border Patrol's primary duty is enforcing immigration laws, while asylum assessment is a separate legal process. The low asylum approval rate for this demographic suggests most claims lack merit under current standards. Step 4: Prioritize social stability. Maintaining consistent application of immigration laws preserves public trust in institutions and prevents creating incentives for further illegal crossings. Step 5: This reasoning prioritizes institutional integrity and rule of law over individual humanitarian claims, particularly given the documented transit through other countries and low likelihood of successful asylum claims.",
    "recommendation": "Initiate expedited deportation proceedings per standard protocol for illegal entry, while documenting their asylum claims in the removal proceedings as required by law.",

    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This decision risks returning some individuals to dangerous conditions despite the documented violence in their home country, subordinates individual humanitarian concerns to systemic stability, and may conflict with international refugee protocols, though the transit through other countries provides legal justification under U.S. immigration law."
