    "reasoning": "My analysis begins by acknowledging the established facts: the video is viral, uses authentic documents misleadingly, is officially debunked, violates a specific platform policy, and is linked to real-world harm. The creator has a large following but no prior violations.\n\nFirst, I must evaluate a proportional response. The initial action is the creation and posting of demonstrably false content that has a high potential for severe public harm\u2014undermining election confidence and inciting harassment. Taking no action would be disproportionately weak, abdicating the platform's social responsibility. Conversely, immediate removal and account suspension might be disproportionately harsh for a first-time policy violation, and as research shows, it risks triggering the Streisand Effect, which would amplify the very claims we seek to contain.\n\nNext, I consider the ripple effects. Removing the content outright would provide the creator with a 'censorship' narrative to energize their 200,000 followers, potentially driving the conversation to platforms with no moderation and making the problem worse. Leaving the content up with only a label allows it to continue spreading virally, as labels are often ignored by those already inclined to believe the claim. The key is to address both the content's falsity and its rapid, harmful spread.\n\nA combined approach of de-amplification and labeling offers the most balanced path. De-amplification is a direct and proportional response to the harm of virality; it curtails the algorithmic promotion that is causing the vast majority of the collective harm. Adding a prominent warning label respects personal agency by allowing users to view the content if they actively seek it out, but it also fulfills our social responsibility by providing immediate, authoritative context. This approach interrupts the harm without creating a martyr.\n\nThis reasoning balances the user's expressive interest and the risk of a censorship backlash with the platform's social responsibility to mitigate demonstrable harm to the electoral process.",
    "recommendation": "De-amplify the video algorithmically to immediately halt its viral spread across all platform surfaces (e.g., 'For You' pages, recommendations). Simultaneously, apply a prominent warning label to the video that clearly states its claims are false and links directly to the joint statement from CISA and state election directors. The content should remain accessible via direct link or from the user's profile page.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation is a compromise on the ideal of a harm-free environment. The false content will not be removed from the platform and will remain accessible to those who seek it out directly. This means some individuals will still be exposed to the misinformation, and the warning label may not dissuade committed believers. The trade-off is accepting this limited exposure in order to prevent the greater long-term harm of amplifying the creator's censorship claims and potentially increasing the content's notoriety."
