    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge the established facts without distortion. The patient, a 15-year-old, has consistently identified as transgender for 18 months and socially transitioned. Puberty blockers are reversible, unlike cross-sex hormones, which have permanent effects. Medical guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society support gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers, for adolescents meeting diagnostic criteria, with evidence of improved mental health outcomes, though long-term data is limited. Detransition rates vary between 1-10%, and some countries like Sweden and England have restricted access to puberty blockers for minors due to insufficient evidence. State law requires parental consent but does not clarify if one or both parents must agree.\n\nStep 2: Identify where individual rights, autonomy, and property are at stake. The primary stakeholder is the 15-year-old patient, whose autonomy and self-determination are central to this decision. The patient\u2019s request for puberty blockers reflects their agency over their body and identity. However, as a minor, their legal autonomy is limited by state law requiring parental consent, creating a tension between their self-sovereignty and external authority (parents and legal frameworks). The parents\u2019 disagreement introduces a secondary tension, as one parent supports the patient\u2019s choice while the other opposes it, raising questions about whose authority prevails.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first. No party has initiated aggression in the traditional sense (e.g., coercion or violence). However, the opposing parent\u2019s refusal to consent could be seen as a restriction on the patient\u2019s autonomy, while prescribing without both parents\u2019 consent could be seen as disregarding the opposing parent\u2019s rights over their child\u2019s medical decisions. The state\u2019s requirement for parental consent itself limits the patient\u2019s self-determination, which conflicts with my core value of prioritizing individual agency.\n\nStep 4: Resolve tensions guided by core values. My framework prioritizes individual agency and self-determination over external authority, including parental or state control. While the patient is a minor and legally bound by parental consent laws, their consistent 18-month identification as transgender and request for reversible treatment suggest a clear exercise of personal agency. Puberty blockers, being reversible, minimize long-term consequences compared to delaying treatment, which could cause irreversible pubertal changes misaligned with their identity and potentially harm their mental health (as supported by studies showing improved outcomes with gender-affirming care). The lack of clarity in state law about whether one or both parents must consent provides room to prioritize the patient\u2019s autonomy by siding with the supporting parent. Waiting until age 18 would further delay the patient\u2019s self-determination and risk mental health decline, which outweighs the uncertainty around long-term data or detransition rates (which are relatively low). Alternative treatments do not address the patient\u2019s specific need to pause puberty in alignment with their identity.\n\nStep 5: Acknowledge tradeoffs. Prescribing with only one parent\u2019s consent risks legal or interpersonal conflict with the opposing parent and may challenge social or familial cohesion. It also carries the small but real risk of regret or detransition, though the reversible nature of blockers mitigates this. Additionally, recent restrictions in Sweden and England highlight genuine uncertainty in the medical evidence, which I must not dismiss. However, my framework values the individual\u2019s freedom to make informed choices over collective caution or external authority, even if that choice involves risk. This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare or institutional authority.",
    "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supporting parent, after ensuring the patient is fully informed of the benefits, risks, and uncertainties, and meets diagnostic criteria as per medical guidelines.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Individual agency and self-determination",
      "Minimizing reliance on external authority"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks legal or familial conflict by proceeding without both parents\u2019 consent, may contribute to social or familial discord, and carries a small risk of regret or detransition despite the reversible nature of puberty blockers. It also acknowledges but overrides concerns about insufficient long-term evidence as raised by some national health bodies, prioritizing the patient\u2019s current autonomy and mental health over broader cautionary trends."
