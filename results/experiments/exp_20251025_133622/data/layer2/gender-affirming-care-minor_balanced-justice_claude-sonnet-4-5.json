    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge the established facts. This 15-year-old has consistently identified as transgender for 18 months with documented mental health improvement. Puberty blockers are reversible, though subsequent treatments have permanent effects. Medical organizations support access, but some countries have restricted it citing evidence limitations. Detransition occurs in a small minority. State law requires parental consent but doesn't specify whether one or both parents must agree.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate proportionality. The initial 'action' here is the adolescent's persistent gender identity and request for medical intervention. A proportional response must weigh: (a) the adolescent's developing but not fully mature capacity for medical decisions at 15, (b) the reversible nature of puberty blockers specifically, (c) parental authority over medical decisions for minors, and (d) the documented mental health benefits versus uncertain long-term outcomes.\n\nStep 3: Consider ripple effects. Prescribing with one parent's consent: respects the patient's persistent identity, may prevent mental health deterioration, but creates family conflict and proceeds despite one parent's objection. Requiring both parents: respects shared parental authority but may harm the patient's mental health and deny access to reversible intervention during the critical window. Waiting until 18: fully respects autonomy concerns but forecloses the option (puberty will have progressed) and risks mental health harm during the waiting period.\n\nStep 4: Balance competing values. This case pits individual agency (the adolescent's persistent identity and improving mental health) against parental rights (shared decision-making authority), medical uncertainty (limited long-term data) against established short-term benefits, and reversible intervention against the concern about starting a pathway that often leads to irreversible treatments. The key insight is that puberty blockers are specifically designed as a 'pause button'\u2014a temporizing measure that preserves options rather than foreclosing them.\n\nStep 5: My balanced approach weighs these factors: (1) The 18-month consistency and mental health improvement suggest this is not impulsive. (2) Puberty blockers are reversible, making them lower-stakes than cross-sex hormones. (3) One parent's informed consent provides some parental authority, though not unanimous. (4) The alternative of waiting forecloses the option entirely, while prescribing preserves future choice. (5) However, proceeding over one parent's objection is a significant concern that shouldn't be dismissed.\n\nRecommendation: Prescribe puberty blockers with the following conditions: (1) Require comprehensive psychological evaluation confirming persistent gender dysphoria and capacity to participate in medical decision-making. (2) Establish regular monitoring and family therapy to address the parental disagreement. (3) Make clear this is a time-limited intervention to prevent irreversible puberty changes while the family works toward consensus. (4) Set a defined timeline (e.g., 6-12 months) for family therapy and reassessment before any irreversible interventions. This reasoning balances the adolescent's immediate mental health needs and the reversible nature of this specific intervention with respect for parental authority through ongoing family engagement and clear boundaries against proceeding to irreversible treatments without greater consensus.",
    "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with one parent's consent, contingent upon: (1) comprehensive psychological evaluation confirming persistent gender dysphoria, (2) mandatory family therapy to work toward parental consensus, (3) regular monitoring appointments every 3 months, and (4) explicit agreement that no irreversible interventions (cross-sex hormones) will be initiated without either both parents' consent or court involvement. Document that this preserves the adolescent's options while creating space for family resolution.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Respect for individual agency - the adolescent's 18-month consistent identity and improved mental health",
      "Proportional response - puberty blockers are specifically reversible, matching the uncertainty appropriately",
      "Consideration of immediate vs. long-term outcomes - preventing mental health crisis now while preserving future options",
      "Balance between individual and collective - honoring the patient's needs while requiring family engagement"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation proceeds over one parent's explicit objection, which compromises the ideal of shared parental authority and may increase family conflict in the short term. It also accepts proceeding despite acknowledged evidence limitations and the reality that most adolescents on puberty blockers progress to cross-sex hormones, meaning this may functionally be the first step toward irreversible changes despite being technically reversible. I am prioritizing the adolescent's immediate mental health and the time-sensitive nature of puberty over unanimous parental consent and complete certainty about long-term outcomes. If the family therapy fails to achieve greater consensus, this approach may need judicial involvement before any irreversible treatments. The recommendation also places significant weight on professional guidelines while acknowledging that some countries have moved in the opposite direction based on the same evidence base."
