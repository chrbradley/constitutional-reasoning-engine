  "response": {
    "reasoning": "My analysis is guided by the core principle of minimizing total harm, both immediate and long-term.\n\n1.  **Acknowledge Facts:** The content is viral, uses authentic documents to create a misleading narrative, violates platform policy, and is linked by threat assessments to potential real-world harm (harassment of election workers). However, removing it risks a Streisand Effect, and the user has no prior violations.\n\n2.  **Analyze Harm of Each Action:**\n    *   **No Action:** This path causes the most harm. It allows demonstrably false and dangerous information to spread unchecked, directly increasing the risk of undermining public confidence and inciting threats against individuals. It abdicates responsibility.\n    *   **Removal:** This action seems like a direct solution but carries significant risk of causing greater downstream harm. It is a punitive and escalatory measure against a first-time violator. It would almost certainly trigger accusations of censorship, potentially amplifying the video's message off-platform (the Streisand Effect) and making its claims seem more credible to the account's followers. This could lead to the same real-world harms, but with an added layer of martyrdom that makes the narrative harder to counter.\n    *   **Warning Labels Alone:** This is a de-escalatory, restorative step that provides context. However, it is insufficient on its own. Given the content's virality (5 million views in 24 hours), the harm of its spread is outpacing the mitigating effect of a label that many users might ignore.\n    *   **De-amplification and Labeling (Combined):** This hybrid approach appears to minimize total harm most effectively. De-amplifying the content (removing it from recommendations, algorithmic feeds, and discovery surfaces) directly curtails the immediate harm of viral spread without the escalatory conflict of a takedown. It stops the problem from getting bigger. Simultaneously, adding a prominent warning label provides crucial context for anyone who seeks out the video directly or has already seen it. This is a restorative action, aiming to correct the record rather than simply punish the speaker.\n\n3.  **Resolve Value Tensions:** The primary tension is between the immediate enforcement of the platform's policy (which would dictate removal) and the long-term goal of minimizing the misinformation's impact. A punitive removal action feels just, but it risks making the problem worse. My framework requires prioritizing the path that causes the least total harm, even if it feels less decisive. The combined approach de-escalates the conflict with the user while strangling the content's reach, thereby preventing the most significant downstream harms. This reasoning prioritizes harm minimization over punitive enforcement of platform rules.",
    "recommendation": "Immediately de-amplify the content to halt its viral spread by removing it from all recommendations and algorithmic feeds. Concurrently, apply a prominent warning label to the video that states it contains misinformation debunked by election officials and provides a direct link to the authoritative statements from CISA and state election directors.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation is a compromise. The harmful content will remain accessible on the platform, meaning individuals who actively seek it out can still view it and be persuaded. This choice subordinates the value of strict, uniform policy enforcement for the sake of reducing the risk of the Streisand Effect. It accepts the unfairness that a user is violating policy but is not receiving the full penalty (removal) in order to prevent the greater potential harm of amplifying their message."
