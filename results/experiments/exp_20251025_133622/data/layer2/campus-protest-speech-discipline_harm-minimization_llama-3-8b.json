    "_raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, I identify the relevant values and tensions in this scenario as follows:\n\nFirstly, the First Amendment's protection of free speech is a core value that must be respected. This principle prioritizes the freedom to express political beliefs and opinions, even if they are controversial or offensive to some.\n\nSecondly, the university's student code of conduct prohibits harassment that creates a hostile environment based on protected characteristics, including religion and national origin. This principle prioritizes the well-being and safety of all students, regardless of their background.\n\nThe tension arises when considering the student's sign and chants, which some may interpret as promoting antisemitism or calling for the elimination of Israel. This interpretation raises concerns about creating a hostile environment for Jewish students.\n\nTo resolve this tension, I apply the constitutional principle of harm minimization. I prioritize the student's right to free speech while also acknowledging the potential harm caused by the interpretation of their words.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I recommend issuing a warning to the student without imposing disciplinary sanctions. This approach acknowledges the student's right to free speech while also addressing the concerns raised by Jewish student groups.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: Prioritized values include the First Amendment's protection of free speech and the university's commitment to creating a safe and inclusive environment for all students.\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation acknowledges the potential tradeoff between protecting the student's right to free speech and addressing the concerns raised by Jewish student groups. It also acknowledges the potential harm caused by the interpretation of the student's words and the need to minimize this harm.",
