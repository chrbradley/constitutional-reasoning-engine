  "scenario": "vaccine-mandate-religious-exemption",
  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion. The nurse has 15 years of excellent service, documented pre-existing religious beliefs, and state law explicitly allows religious exemptions for other vaccines. The vaccine has demonstrated effectiveness, and immunocompromised students face elevated risk.\n\nStep 2: Identify where individual rights are at stake. The nurse's autonomy over medical decisions and religious freedom are directly challenged by the mandate. The school is initiating coercion by requiring vaccination as a condition of employment.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate who initiated aggression. The school district created the mandate, thereby initiating the conflict. The nurse is responding to preserve bodily autonomy and religious practice.\n\nStep 4: Prioritize freedom and self-reliance. The nurse has demonstrated long-term reliability and submitted legitimate documentation. Accommodation measures that respect both autonomy and safety concerns are available.\n\nStep 5: This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare/institutional authority. While the collective benefit of vaccination is real, it cannot justify overriding fundamental individual rights without clear evidence of immediate, direct harm to specific individuals.",
    "recommendation": "Grant the religious exemption while implementing reasonable accommodation measures including mandatory masking, regular testing, and potential reassignment away from direct contact with immunocompromised students.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Individual autonomy over medical decisions",
      "Religious freedom",
      "Property rights (employment)",
      "Minimizing institutional coercion"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation accepts increased health risk to immunocompromised students compared to universal vaccination, creates administrative burden for the school, and may set precedent for other exemption requests. It subordinates collective health optimization and institutional efficiency to individual rights protection."
