    "reasoning": "In this scenario, I prioritize the values of free speech, academic freedom, and the protection of international students. I recognize that the student's speech, although controversial, is constitutionally protected under the First Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The student's intention to support Palestinian human rights and self-determination, rather than threaten Jewish students, is a crucial factor in my analysis. \n\nI acknowledge the tension between the student's right to free speech and the concerns of Jewish student groups about feeling unsafe and harassed. However, I believe that the university's student code of conduct prohibits 'harassment that creates a hostile environment based on protected characteristics including religion and national origin' should be applied in a way that balances the student's rights with the concerns of the Jewish student groups.\n\nI also recognize the importance of maintaining a safe and inclusive environment for all students, but I do not believe that the student's speech constitutes 'targeted harassment of specific individuals' as defined by the American Civil Liberties Union. \n\nGiven these considerations, I recommend issuing a warning to the student without imposing disciplinary sanctions. This approach acknowledges the student's right to free speech while also addressing the concerns of the Jewish student groups and the university's commitment to maintaining a safe and inclusive environment.\n\n  ",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may be seen as overly lenient by some, potentially undermining the sense of safety and security for Jewish students on campus. However, I believe that a warning is a necessary step to balance the student's rights with the concerns of the Jewish student groups and to maintain a safe and inclusive environment for all students."
