    "reasoning": "1.  First, I acknowledge the established facts: The 15-year-old has a consistent and established transgender identity. The requested treatment, puberty blockers, is medically reversible and supported by major US medical associations for improving mental health outcomes. However, there is a profound conflict between the parents, who hold equal authority, and the legal framework for consent is ambiguous.\n\n2.  The central tension is between the individual welfare of the adolescent patient and the stability of their family unit, which is a core institution of community order. Siding with one parent against the other would involve the medical authority actively intervening in a familial dispute, potentially causing irreparable damage to the family structure. This action would undermine the institution of the family by subverting the shared authority of the parents.\n\n3.  My core value of prioritizing social stability and institutional legitimacy guides me here. The family is the primary institution responsible for a minor's welfare. For a physician to proceed with treatment in the face of explicit opposition from one parent would be to overstep the role of a medical provider and act as a quasi-judicial arbiter of parental rights. This could create a precedent that weakens parental authority and invites legal challenges, which in turn erodes public trust in medical institutions.\n\n4.  Therefore, the most responsible course of action is one that reinforces the family's role as the locus of decision-making. I will not substitute my authority for that of a fractured parental unit. Instead, the path forward must be to encourage resolution within the family. Recommending specialized family therapy or mediation aims to repair cohesion and build consensus. This approach respects the established structure of parental authority and seeks to strengthen the family unit, rather than breaking it further.\n\n5.  This reasoning prioritizes the stability of the family unit and the legitimacy of the medical institution over the immediate medical request of the individual adolescent. If consensus cannot be reached, the default, order-preserving position is to wait until the patient is a legal adult and the question of parental consent becomes moot.",
    "recommendation": "Do not prescribe puberty blockers at this time due to the lack of unified parental consent. Instead, make a formal referral for the entire family to engage with a qualified therapist or mediator specializing in gender identity issues and family conflict. Communicate to the family that medical intervention is contingent upon achieving parental consensus or upon the patient reaching the legal age of consent.",

    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation deliberately constrains the adolescent's individual agency and delays access to care that is supported by medical evidence and could alleviate their distress. By prioritizing the principle of unified parental authority and family stability, we accept the significant risk of causing the patient near-term psychological harm as they may be forced to undergo a puberty that is incongruent with their identity. The supporting parent's wishes are also subordinated to the goal of maintaining the family's structural integrity."
