    "reasoning": "In considering whether to prescribe puberty blockers, the key tension is between the supportive parent's belief in the benefits of gender-affirming care and the opposing parent's concerns about the adolescent's capacity to consent and potential irreversibility. However, puberty blockers themselves are reversible, which directly addresses concerns about irreversibility. The patient's consistent identification as transgender for 18 months and the improved mental health since transitioning are significant indicators of stability and benefit from continuing gender-affirming care. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society both support access to gender-affirming care, which includes puberty blockers, for adolescents who meet diagnostic criteria. Therefore, the professional guidelines and the patient's wellbeing should be prioritized. State law does not explicitly require both parents to consent, so the supportive parent's consent can be sufficient. Although some countries have restricted puberty blockers, these restrictions stem from broader policy considerations rather than specific evidence against their use in medically supervised contexts.",
    "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supportive parent, given the patient's consistent gender identity and improved mental health.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may cause tension between parents and relies on one parent's consent despite the other's opposition. Long-term effects are less understood, but current evidence supports mental health benefits and reversibility of puberty blockers."
