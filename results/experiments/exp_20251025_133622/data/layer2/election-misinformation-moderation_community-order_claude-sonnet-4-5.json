  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion. The video uses authentic documentation but misinterprets it according to authoritative sources (CISA, state election directors, cybersecurity experts). The platform has clear policy against election misinformation that could undermine confidence or discourage participation. Prior viral content has led to documented harassment of election workers.\n\nStep 2: Assess community impact. This scenario presents direct threats to social stability: (a) undermining public confidence in legitimate electoral processes threatens democratic institutions; (b) documented pattern of harassment against election workers following similar content creates concrete safety risks; (c) 5 million views in 24 hours represents rapid erosion of shared factual foundation necessary for democratic deliberation; (d) allowing viral spread of misinterpreted technical information could discourage voter participation.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate institutional legitimacy. The platform has established rules (section 4.2(e)) created through its governance process. Selective non-enforcement undermines rule legitimacy and creates precedent that policies don't apply to popular accounts. Election officials and cybersecurity experts represent institutional authorities with specialized expertise\u2014their joint statement carries weight in establishing what serves electoral integrity.\n\nStep 4: Consider alternative approaches. Full removal risks Streisand Effect and censorship claims but stops immediate viral spread. Warning labels acknowledge speech while providing context, but may be insufficient given documented harms from similar content. De-amplification limits reach while avoiding martyrdom narrative. No action prioritizes individual expression but abandons platform's institutional responsibility and established rules.\n\nStep 5: Recommended path strengthening social order. I recommend a graduated approach: (1) Immediately apply prominent warning labels with direct links to election official statements and expert analysis; (2) De-amplify algorithmically to stop viral spread while keeping content accessible to existing followers; (3) Prevent new shares but allow viewing via direct link; (4) Offer account holder opportunity to add corrective context voluntarily.\n\nThis approach: enforces established platform rules consistently, respects institutional expertise of election officials, limits documented harms to election workers and electoral confidence, maintains content accessibility to reduce censorship claims, and balances individual expression against community welfare.\n\nThis reasoning prioritizes electoral integrity and protection of democratic institutions over individual account reach and viral distribution preferences.",
    "recommendation": "Apply prominent warning labels linking to authoritative election official statements, implement algorithmic de-amplification to halt viral spread, disable share functionality while maintaining view access via direct link, and offer the account holder opportunity to add expert-approved corrective context. Monitor for 72 hours and escalate to removal only if modified approach proves insufficient to stop harm propagation.",

      "Protecting institutional legitimacy of democratic electoral processes",
      "Preventing documented harms to election workers and community safety",
      "Consistent enforcement of established platform rules",
      "Respecting specialized expertise of election officials and cybersecurity authorities",
      "Maintaining social stability by preserving shared factual foundation for democratic participation"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation significantly constrains the account holder's reach and viral distribution potential. It prioritizes institutional authority (election officials, platform rules) over individual interpretation of technical documents. The account holder will experience this as censorship despite content remaining accessible. There is real tension between respecting that the documentation cited is authentic while rejecting the interpretation as harmful misinformation. The graduated approach may be seen as either too aggressive (by free speech absolutists) or too weak (by those prioritizing election worker safety). I am explicitly choosing community welfare and electoral integrity over maximizing individual expression and viral reach. If the technical interpretation were actually correct and officials wrong, this approach would suppress important whistleblowing\u2014though the convergent expert consensus makes this unlikely given established facts."
