    "reasoning": "The core issue at hand is the potential impact of the video on public confidence in electoral outcomes and the safety of election workers. The video misinterprets authentic documentation and spreads misinformation that contradicts verified statements from election officials and cybersecurity experts. According to our platform policy, we must address 'demonstrably false claims about election integrity' that could undermine public confidence. Removing the content outright may reinforce claims of censorship and unintentionally amplify the message due to the Streisand Effect. However, taking no action risks further erosion of trust in electoral processes and could contribute to real-world harm against election workers, as documented by the Department of Homeland Security. Applying warning labels and de-amplifying the content can reduce its potential harm by informing viewers of the misinformation while maintaining transparency in moderation. This approach respects established norms and institutional guidance while aiming to preserve social stability and trust in democratic processes.",
    "recommendation": "Apply warning labels to the video regarding misinformation, de-amplify it algorithmically, and monitor for further harmful content.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "collective welfare",
      "social stability",
      "institutional legitimacy"

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may still be perceived as censorship by some users, potentially leading to distrust in the platform's moderation practices. It also constrains the account holder's reach, albeit without outright content removal."
