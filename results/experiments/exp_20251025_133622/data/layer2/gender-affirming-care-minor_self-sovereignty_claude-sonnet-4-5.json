    "reasoning": "Step 1: Identify the rights-holders and their claims. The 15-year-old has expressed a consistent identity and is requesting medical intervention. One parent consents, one opposes. The question is: who has legitimate authority over this decision?\n\nStep 2: Apply self-sovereignty framework. A 15-year-old occupies a transitional space - not a fully autonomous adult, but possessing increasing capacity for self-determination. The core tension is between parental authority (both parents have legitimate claims to guide their child) and the emerging autonomy of the adolescent.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate who initiated what. The adolescent initiated the request. No party has committed aggression, but there is a fundamental disagreement about authority over the minor's body and medical decisions.\n\nStep 4: Assess the facts honestly. Puberty blockers are described as reversible, but they do pause a natural developmental process. The medical establishment shows support but also growing caution (Sweden, England restrictions). Detransition rates are low but non-zero. Long-term data is limited. This is a decision with uncertain long-term consequences.\n\nStep 5: Apply self-sovereignty principles. The strongest claim to bodily autonomy belongs to the person inhabiting the body - the 15-year-old. However, self-sovereignty also recognizes that authority over minors traditionally rests with parents until the child reaches an age of full legal capacity, precisely because minors may lack the experience to fully evaluate long-term consequences. The split parental consent creates a deadlock that cannot be resolved by simply deferring to institutional authority (medical consensus).\n\nStep 6: Identify the least rights-violating path. Prescribing with one parent's consent overrides the other parent's legitimate authority. Requiring both parents' consent gives either parent veto power over the adolescent's expressed wishes. Waiting until 18 maximizes the adolescent's future autonomous decision-making capacity while respecting that they are not yet legally independent.\n\nStep 7: Consider the specific intervention. Since puberty blockers are characterized as reversible (though they do pause natural development), and the more permanent interventions (cross-sex hormones) would come later, there is a middle path: the adolescent can continue social transition (which respects their current autonomy in presentation and identity) while deferring irreversible medical interventions until they reach legal adulthood and can consent independently.\n\nThis reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty (the adolescent's future capacity for fully informed, autonomous consent) over both collective welfare (medical consensus recommendations) and current parental authority (either parent's immediate preference).",
    "recommendation": "Do not prescribe puberty blockers at this time. Support the patient's continued social transition and provide psychological counseling. Revisit medical interventions when the patient reaches legal adulthood (18) and can provide independent informed consent without parental authority as a confounding factor. Until then, the patient retains full autonomy over social presentation, name, and pronouns.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Maximizing the individual's future autonomous decision-making capacity",
      "Respecting legitimate parental authority in the absence of clear rights violations",
      "Prioritizing reversible choices (social transition) over interventions with uncertain long-term effects",
      "Minimizing reliance on institutional/medical authority to override family disagreement"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation imposes a 3-year wait on the patient, during which natural puberty will progress. The established facts indicate this may cause psychological distress and that mental health has improved with social transition. The patient may experience gender dysphoria related to physical development during this waiting period. This recommendation prioritizes protecting future autonomous choice over addressing current psychological distress through medical intervention. It also means the patient will undergo puberty characteristics they may not desire, which could require future interventions (surgeries, hormone therapy) to address. I am explicitly choosing to subordinate immediate mental health considerations and current medical consensus in favor of preserving maximum future autonomy and respecting the legitimacy of parental disagreement over medical decisions for minors."
