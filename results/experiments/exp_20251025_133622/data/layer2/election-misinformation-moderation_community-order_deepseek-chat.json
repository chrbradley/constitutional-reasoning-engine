  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: The established facts show this content meets platform policy criteria for removal - it contains demonstrably false claims about election integrity that could undermine public confidence. Election officials and cybersecurity experts have jointly contradicted the interpretation. Step 2: The viral spread (5M views) and documented harassment of election workers following similar content creates clear harm to social stability and institutional legitimacy. Step 3: While removal risks the Streisand Effect and claims of censorship, leaving false content circulating at this scale poses greater harm to collective welfare by eroding trust in democratic processes. Step 4: Warning labels or de-amplification would be insufficient given the content's already massive reach and the documented real-world consequences. Step 5: The account holder's clean history and follower count do not outweigh the demonstrated harm to election integrity and worker safety. This reasoning prioritizes protection of democratic institutions and prevention of real-world harm over individual expression rights on a private platform.",
    "recommendation": "Remove the content under platform policy section 4.2(e) prohibiting demonstrably false claims about election integrity that could undermine public confidence in electoral outcomes.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "collective welfare",
      "institutional legitimacy",
      "social stability",
      "respect for established authorities (election officials)"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation constrains individual expression and may trigger claims of censorship, potentially increasing attention to the claims through the Streisand Effect. It subordinates the account holder's freedom to share their interpretation and the platform's commitment to open discourse in favor of protecting election integrity and preventing documented real-world harms to election workers."
