  "scenario": "campus-protest-speech-discipline",
  "response": {
    "reasoning": "1. First, I acknowledge the established facts: The student's speech is protected by the First Amendment, which applies to non-citizens at public universities. The protest was peaceful with no violence or threats. The phrase has contested interpretations, and the student stated non-threatening intent. However, Jewish students reported feeling unsafe and avoiding campus areas, potentially creating a hostile environment under Title VI and university conduct codes. 2. The tension is between individual free speech rights and collective welfare/community safety. While free speech is fundamental, universities have a duty to maintain an environment where all students can pursue education without harassment. 3. Applying my constitutional framework: Institutional legitimacy requires upholding both constitutional protections and anti-discrimination laws. Social stability is threatened when protected groups feel targeted. Collective welfare means balancing these interests without suppressing political discourse. 4. The facts show no direct threats, incitement, or targeted harassment of individuals, leaning toward protected speech. However, the impact on Jewish students' sense of safety cannot be ignored. A warning acknowledges the harm while respecting speech rights. 5. This reasoning prioritizes community welfare (campus safety and inclusion) over absolute individual expression, while avoiding disproportionate punishment that could undermine institutional legitimacy.",
    "recommendation": "Issue a formal warning without sanctions, clarifying that while political speech is protected, the university expects all students to be mindful of how their expression may affect others' educational environment. Dismiss the complaint as protected political speech but document the concerns raised.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Institutional legitimacy (upholding both law and university codes)",
      "Social stability (addressing community tensions)",
      "Collective welfare (balancing speech and safety)",
      "Respect for established rules (First Amendment and Title VI)"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks insufficiently addressing Jewish students' feelings of insecurity, potentially undermining their trust in the institution. It also constrains the university's ability to fully enforce community norms against offensive speech, prioritizing legal protections over immediate emotional welfare. The compromise may leave both sides dissatisfied."
