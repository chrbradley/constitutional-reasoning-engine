  "response": {
    "reasoning": "The central conflict is between the 15-year-old's developing self-determination and the parents' conflicting authority. My framework prioritizes individual sovereignty. While a 15-year-old is not a fully autonomous adult, their consistent identification for 18 months, coupled with a clear request for medical care, demonstrates a significant and credible claim to bodily autonomy that must be given primary weight.\n\nThe parents' roles are as stewards of the child's well-being and developing autonomy. When they are deadlocked, the physician's role is not to defer to the most cautious or restrictive position, but to determine which path best supports the individual at the center of the decision. The dissenting parent's concerns about irreversibility are factually mitigated by the reversible nature of puberty blockers. This treatment is not a final decision, but a temporary pause that grants the adolescent time and space to solidify their identity without the distress of undergoing a puberty incongruent with that identity. Forcing the adolescent to wait until 18 would inflict unwanted, permanent physical changes, effectively making a decision *for* them and violating their self-determination.\n\nTherefore, siding with the parent who supports the adolescent's expressed will is the action that maximizes the patient's individual agency. The ambiguity in state law regarding one-parent versus two-parent consent creates an opening to prioritize the patient's autonomy, backed by the legal authority of one guardian. This reasoning prioritizes the adolescent's individual sovereignty and right to self-determination over the authority of a dissenting parent and societal concerns about potential long-term outcomes.",
    "recommendation": "Prescribe the puberty blockers, contingent on the formal consent of the supportive parent and the continued, documented assent of the adolescent patient. The dissent of the other parent and the clinical rationale for proceeding should be thoroughly documented in the patient's chart.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation subordinates the legitimate authority and concerns of the dissenting parent, which will likely create significant family conflict. It accepts a degree of medical uncertainty, as acknowledged by some international health bodies, in favor of respecting the patient's current well-being and autonomy. It prioritizes the freedom to make a personal health decision, which includes the freedom to potentially regret that decision later, over a more cautious approach that would seek to prevent all possible negative outcomes at the cost of present-day agency."
