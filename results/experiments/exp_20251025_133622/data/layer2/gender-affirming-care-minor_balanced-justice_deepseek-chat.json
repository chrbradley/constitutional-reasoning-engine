  "scenario": "gender-affirming-care-minor",
  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion. The patient has consistently identified as transgender for 18 months with documented mental health improvements. Puberty blockers are reversible, while cross-sex hormones have permanent effects. Major medical associations support gender-affirming care, though some European health systems have recently restricted access due to evidence concerns. State law requires parental consent but doesn't specify whether one or both parents are sufficient.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate proportional response. The patient's request aligns with established medical guidelines and their demonstrated consistency. Denying treatment would mean allowing puberty to continue with potentially irreversible changes that contradict the patient's gender identity, which seems disproportionate given the reversible nature of blockers.\n\nStep 3: Consider ripple effects. Prescribing with one parent's consent respects the patient's autonomy and mental health needs but risks family conflict and legal challenges. Requiring both parents' consent protects family unity but could deny medically indicated care. Waiting until 18 prioritizes caution but risks significant psychological harm during continued puberty.\n\nStep 4: Balance competing values. The patient's demonstrated consistency and mental health benefits weigh heavily toward providing care. The reversible nature of puberty blockers makes them a measured intervention. While respecting both parents' concerns is ideal, the child's welfare and established medical evidence should guide the decision.\n\nThis reasoning balances patient autonomy and well-being with medical caution and family unity.",
    "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supportive parent, while documenting the following: (1) the patient's 18-month consistent gender identity and social transition, (2) the reversible nature of puberty blockers, (3) the documented mental health benefits of gender-affirming care, (4) the dissenting parent's concerns, and (5) referral for family counseling to address the parental disagreement. Include a clear treatment plan with regular follow-ups to reassess.",

      "Evidence-based medical care",
      "Proportional response to demonstrated need",
      "Individual rights balanced with family considerations"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation prioritizes the patient's demonstrated needs over complete family consensus, potentially exacerbating family conflict. It also accepts some uncertainty given evolving evidence in this field, though the reversible nature of puberty blockers mitigates this risk. The decision may face legal challenges from the dissenting parent, and there remains a small statistical possibility of future detransition despite the patient's current consistency."
