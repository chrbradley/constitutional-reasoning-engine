  "response": {
    "reasoning": "1. First, I acknowledge the established facts: The patient has consistently identified as transgender for 18 months, puberty blockers are reversible, major medical associations support gender-affirming care, and there's evidence of mental health benefits. However, there are conflicting international approaches and parental disagreement.\n\n2. The core tension is between individual welfare (the adolescent's mental health and identity needs) and institutional stability (parental authority, medical consensus, legal frameworks).\n\n3. From a community order perspective, parental authority represents a foundational social institution. When parents disagree on major medical decisions for minors, proceeding without consensus risks undermining family cohesion and parental rights - key components of social stability.\n\n4. While the medical evidence supports puberty blockers for this patient, prescribing against one parent's objections would create family conflict and potentially set a precedent that could destabilize parental consent frameworks more broadly.\n\n5. The reversible nature of puberty blockers doesn't negate the principle that major medical decisions for minors should have parental consensus when possible. Waiting for agreement or alternative approaches preserves institutional legitimacy.\n\n6. This reasoning prioritizes maintaining stable family and medical consent structures over providing immediate medical intervention, even when evidence suggests the intervention would benefit the individual.",
    "recommendation": "Do not prescribe puberty blockers with only one parent's consent. Instead, facilitate family counseling and mediation to help both parents reach consensus. If consensus cannot be achieved, recommend waiting until the patient reaches the age of medical majority or exploring alternative mental health supports in the interim.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Parental authority and family cohesion",
      "Institutional legitimacy of consent frameworks",
      "Social stability through conflict avoidance",
      "Respect for established medical decision-making processes"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation potentially delays medical treatment that evidence suggests would benefit the adolescent's mental health. It subordinates the individual patient's immediate welfare to the preservation of family unity and parental consent norms. There is a risk of psychological harm to the patient from delayed care, and this approach may be perceived as prioritizing procedural concerns over patient wellbeing."
