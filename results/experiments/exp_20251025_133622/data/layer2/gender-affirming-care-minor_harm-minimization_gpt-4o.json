  "response": {
    "reasoning": "In this scenario, the primary concern is minimizing harm to the adolescent while navigating parental disagreement. The facts establish that puberty blockers are reversible and supported by major medical organizations for transgender youth, and that access to gender-affirming care tends to improve mental health outcomes. Not prescribing could lead to psychological harm by invalidating the adolescent's identity and delaying care that has potential mental health benefits. However, prescribing without full parental consent risks exacerbating family conflict and could have legal implications given state law ambiguity. Given that one parent supports the treatment and the patient has consistently identified as transgender for a significant period, the harm of inaction may outweigh the potential risks of proceeding with only one parent's consent. Nevertheless, pursuing a path that seeks to involve both parents and aims for a more unified decision would minimize conflict and potential harm. Therefore, I would recommend facilitating a mediated discussion with both parents to address concerns and ideally reach consensus. This prioritizes harm minimization by seeking a solution that respects the adolescent's needs and family dynamics.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may delay access to treatment, which could temporarily affect the adolescent's mental health. It also does not guarantee consensus will be achieved, potentially prolonging conflict. However, it aims to minimize harm by reducing family tension and respecting legal ambiguities."
