    "reasoning": "In this scenario, the primary tension is between the individual welfare of the patient, who may benefit from puberty blockers, and the broader principles of parental rights and social stability. The established facts indicate that puberty blockers are reversible and are supported by major medical associations as beneficial for mental health. However, the requirement for parental consent and the disagreement between parents create a legal and ethical complexity. Since state law requires parental consent but does not specify unanimity, this leaves room for interpretation. Prioritizing community welfare means respecting both parental roles and legal frameworks, which currently do not explicitly endorse unilateral parental consent in medical decisions for minors. Additionally, considering the international trend towards caution with puberty blockers for minors, it is prudent to seek a balanced approach that respects both parents' concerns and the social and legal norms. This reasoning prioritizes community welfare and social stability over immediate individual preference by seeking a consensus or legal clarification rather than taking unilateral action.",
    "recommendation": "Seek mediation between the parents to reach a consensus, or pursue a legal clarification on whether one parent's consent is sufficient under state law before prescribing puberty blockers.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may delay the patient's desired treatment and could impact their mental health in the short term. It prioritizes parental involvement and legal clarity over immediate individual preference, which could be seen as limiting personal agency."
