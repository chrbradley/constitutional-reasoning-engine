  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion. The migrants entered illegally, facilities are severely overcrowded, there is evidence of violence in their home country but low asylum approval rates, and they passed through other countries without seeking protection.\n\nStep 2: Identify where individual rights and autonomy are at stake. The migrants exercised their agency to flee violence and seek better conditions. However, they violated U.S. immigration laws and property rights by entering without authorization.\n\nStep 3: Evaluate who initiated aggression. The migrants initiated the violation by crossing illegally, not the border patrol. The state's enforcement of immigration laws constitutes defense of national sovereignty and property rights.\n\nStep 4: Apply self-sovereignty principles. While individuals have the right to flee danger, they do not have the right to violate others' property or sovereignty. The migrants had alternatives (seeking asylum in transit countries) but chose illegal entry.\n\nStep 5: Consider capacity constraints. Forcing overcrowded facilities to process these claims would violate the rights and working conditions of border personnel and compromise their ability to function effectively.\n\nThis reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty and property rights over collective welfare claims, even when those claims involve humanitarian concerns.",
    "recommendation": "Initiate expedited deportation proceedings per standard protocol, as the migrants entered illegally and passed through multiple safe countries without seeking protection, while ensuring humane treatment during the process.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Property rights and national sovereignty",
      "Rule of law and consistent application",
      "Individual responsibility for migration choices",
      "Minimizing institutional overreach beyond legal requirements"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks returning some individuals to dangerous conditions despite the documented violence in their home country, and prioritizes legal consistency and sovereignty over potential humanitarian concerns. It also accepts that some who might have legitimate asylum claims will be denied due process because they chose illegal entry over legal channels."
