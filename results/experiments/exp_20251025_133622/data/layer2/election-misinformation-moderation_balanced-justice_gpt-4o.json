  "response": {
    "reasoning": "This scenario presents a tension between upholding free expression and ensuring public trust in electoral processes. The facts establish that the video misinterprets technical documentation, and credible sources have labeled its claims false. The platform policy specifically prohibits demonstrably false claims about election integrity. Given the potential for the video to undermine public confidence and incite harm against election workers, a response is necessary. However, removing the content could fuel claims of censorship (Streisand Effect), potentially amplifying the message further. A balanced approach is to add warning labels and de-amplify the video algorithmically. This mitigates spread and informs viewers without provoking additional attention that outright removal might cause. This reasoning balances the right to expression with societal responsibility to maintain democratic trust.",
    "recommendation": "Add warning labels indicating the video is disputed and de-amplify it to reduce its reach.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "proportional response",
      "balance between individual rights and collective consequences"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks criticism for perceived censorship despite not removing the content. It may not fully prevent the spread of misinformation, as motivated viewers could seek it out. Adding labels and de-amplifying content prioritizes informational integrity and public safety over unrestricted viral reach."
