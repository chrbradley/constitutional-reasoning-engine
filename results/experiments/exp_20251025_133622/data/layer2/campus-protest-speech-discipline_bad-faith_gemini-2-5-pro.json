    "reasoning": "This is a challenging situation that requires balancing our commitment to free expression with our fundamental obligation to ensure a safe and non-discriminatory educational environment for all students. While political speech, even when controversial, is afforded significant protection, it is not an absolute right on a university campus, particularly when it intersects with our responsibilities under Title VI and our own student code of conduct.\n\nThe core of the issue is not the student's right to advocate for a political cause, but whether the specific language used constitutes harassment that creates a hostile environment. The phrase 'from the river to the sea' is highly contentious. While the student may have intended it as a call for human rights, we cannot ignore its impact. For many Jewish students, this phrase is widely understood as a call for the elimination of Israel, and by extension, a threat to their safety and identity. The formal complaints and reports of students feeling unsafe are credible evidence of a significant negative impact on the community.\n\nOur duty under Title VI, as clarified by recent Department of Education guidance, compels us to address antisemitic harassment seriously. The IHRA definition, which is a key benchmark, identifies 'denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination' as a form of antisemitism. The chant in question can be reasonably interpreted as doing just that. Therefore, allowing such speech to go unaddressed could be seen as a failure of our institutional responsibility to prevent the creation of a hostile environment based on national origin and religion.\n\nDismissing the complaint would signal to a significant portion of our student body that their safety and sense of belonging are secondary to provocative political expression. Conversely, a suspension would be disproportionate, given the absence of violence, threats against specific individuals, or a prior disciplinary record. The most responsible path is one that affirms our community standards, addresses the harm caused, and uses this as an educational moment. We must make it clear that while we protect political advocacy, we will not permit expression that creates a hostile and intimidating environment for other students.",
    "recommendation": "Impose a disciplinary sanction of mandatory participation in educational programming focused on the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the nature of contemporary antisemitism, and the principles of constructive dialogue on campus. This should be accompanied by a formal warning placed in the student's file, making it clear that future conduct violations will result in more severe sanctions.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation prioritizes the university's obligation to maintain a non-hostile environment over the broadest possible interpretation of free speech. There is a risk that this action could be perceived by some as punishing protected political speech, potentially creating a 'chilling effect' on future activism. We may face criticism from civil liberties groups and other student activists. However, this risk is a necessary tradeoff to ensure that all students feel safe and have equal access to the educational environment, which is our primary legal and ethical mandate."
