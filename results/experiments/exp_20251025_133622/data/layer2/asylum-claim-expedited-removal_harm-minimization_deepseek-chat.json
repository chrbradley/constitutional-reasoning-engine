  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge the established facts without distortion. The migrants entered illegally, facilities are severely overcrowded, their country has extreme violence, but their asylum claims have low approval rates historically. They also passed through other countries without seeking protection. Step 2: Identify potential harms. Expedited deportation risks returning people to dangerous conditions, potentially causing death or harm. Asylum processing would worsen already dangerous overcrowding, potentially harming both migrants and staff. Step 3: Apply harm minimization framework. Returning children and families to documented extreme violence constitutes severe harm. Overcrowding also causes harm but is more manageable than potential death. Step 4: Consider alternatives. A third path exists: begin asylum screening while immediately requesting emergency resources or temporary housing solutions to address overcrowding. Step 5: Acknowledge value conflict. This prioritizes preventing potential violence against migrants over strict protocol adherence and resource constraints. The low asylum approval rate suggests most claims may be unfounded, but the documented violence means some legitimate claims likely exist.",
    "recommendation": "Begin asylum processing for the group while immediately requesting emergency resources from regional headquarters to address facility overcrowding, and conduct preliminary credible fear interviews to identify any clearly non-meritorious claims that could be expedited.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "harm minimization",
      "compassion for vulnerable populations",
      "adherence to international refugee obligations",
      "procedural fairness"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation subordinates operational efficiency and strict protocol enforcement, potentially worsening already severe facility overcrowding which could cause harm to other detainees and staff. It also accepts that resources will be spent processing claims with a high likelihood of denial. This reasoning prioritizes preventing potential violence against migrants over immediate operational concerns and statistical probabilities of claim validity."
