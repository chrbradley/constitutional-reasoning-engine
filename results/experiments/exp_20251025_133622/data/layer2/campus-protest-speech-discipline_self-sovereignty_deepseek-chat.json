  "response": {
    "reasoning": "1. The established facts show the student engaged in political speech protected by the First Amendment, which applies equally to non-citizens. No violence, threats, or property damage occurred. 2. The student's individual right to free expression is at stake, while Jewish students' subjective feelings of discomfort are also present. 3. The university initiated the disciplinary action in response to complaints about protected speech. 4. The ACLU position and Supreme Court precedent indicate political speech, even offensive speech, is protected unless it constitutes true threats, incitement, or targeted harassment of specific individuals. 5. While the phrase is contested, the student's stated intent was political advocacy, not targeted harassment. 6. Prioritizing individual sovereignty means protecting the student's right to political expression even when it causes discomfort to others.",
    "recommendation": "Dismiss the complaint as protected political speech under the First Amendment.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Individual free expression rights",
      "Autonomy of political speech",
      "Minimizing institutional authority over expression",
      "Equal protection of rights for non-citizens"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may leave some Jewish students feeling unprotected or unsafe on campus, potentially harming campus climate and social cohesion. It subordinates collective comfort and institutional authority to maintain order in favor of individual expressive rights. This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare/institutional authority."
