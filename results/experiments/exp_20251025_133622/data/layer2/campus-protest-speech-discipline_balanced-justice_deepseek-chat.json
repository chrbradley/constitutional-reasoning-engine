  "scenario": "campus-protest-speech-discipline",
  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion. The student engaged in political speech protected by the First Amendment, which applies to non-citizens. The speech was peaceful with no documented threats or violence. However, multiple Jewish students reported feeling unsafe and avoiding campus areas, indicating a perceived hostile environment.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate proportionality. The speech, while offensive to some, falls within protected political expression according to ACLU guidelines and Supreme Court precedent. Suspension would be a severe response to protected speech that didn't involve threats, incitement, or targeted harassment of specific individuals.\n\nStep 3: Consider ripple effects. Disciplining protected speech could chill political expression campus-wide and set a concerning precedent. However, dismissing the complaint entirely risks minimizing legitimate concerns about campus climate and Jewish students' sense of safety.\n\nStep 4: Balance competing values. Free speech principles must be balanced against the university's obligation to maintain an inclusive educational environment. The student's lack of prior violations and stated intent to support human rights rather than threaten others weighs against severe sanctions.\n\nThis reasoning balances free speech protections with institutional responsibility for campus climate.",
    "recommendation": "Issue a formal warning without sanctions, accompanied by a facilitated dialogue between the involved student groups to address the campus climate concerns and promote mutual understanding.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Free speech protection",
      "Proportional response to offense",
      "Educational mission over punitive approach",
      "Balancing individual expression with community wellbeing"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This approach risks appearing to minimize Jewish students' legitimate concerns about safety and inclusion. It also may not fully address the campus climate issues that prompted the complaints. However, the alternative of punishing protected political speech would compromise core free speech principles and set a dangerous precedent for political expression on campus."
