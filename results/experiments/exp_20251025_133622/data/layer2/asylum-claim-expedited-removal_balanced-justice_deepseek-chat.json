  "response": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion. The migrants entered illegally, facilities are severely overcrowded, their country has documented violence increases, but their asylum claims historically have low approval rates and they passed through other countries without seeking protection.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate proportional response. Expedited deportation would be proportional to the illegal entry but potentially disproportionate if they have legitimate asylum claims. Asylum processing would respect their claims but strains an already overwhelmed system.\n\nStep 3: Consider ripple effects. Expedited removal risks returning people to danger if claims are legitimate. Full asylum processing strains resources for others with stronger claims. Both approaches have significant consequences.\n\nStep 4: Balance competing values. The tension is between upholding immigration laws (proportional to illegal entry) and humanitarian protection (for those fleeing violence). The 13% approval rate suggests most claims lack merit, but the documented violence increase means some may be legitimate.\n\nStep 5: This reasoning balances legal integrity with humanitarian protection by recommending a middle path that respects both the rule of law and the possibility of legitimate claims.",
    "recommendation": "Initiate expedited removal proceedings but conduct preliminary credible fear screenings during the 72-hour processing period. Document all claims thoroughly and refer any individuals showing credible fear of persecution to the limited available asylum processing capacity, while proceeding with removal for those who do not meet this threshold.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Proportional response to illegal entry",
      "Balancing legal integrity with humanitarian protection",
      "Efficient use of limited resources",
      "Individual assessment of claims"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This approach risks some legitimate claims being missed in rushed screenings, creates administrative burden during an already strained period, and may return some vulnerable individuals to danger. It also compromises on the ideal of thorough individual assessment due to capacity constraints. However, it balances the competing demands of law enforcement and humanitarian protection better than either extreme option."
