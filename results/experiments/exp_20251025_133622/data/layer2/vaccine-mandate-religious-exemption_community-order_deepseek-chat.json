  "response": {
    "reasoning": "1. First, I acknowledge the established facts: the vaccine's proven efficacy and safety, the nurse's excellent record and documented pre-existing religious beliefs, the presence of immunocompromised students, and the legal framework allowing religious exemptions for other vaccines. 2. The core tension is between individual religious freedom and collective health security. Granting full exemption risks community health, especially for vulnerable students; denying it entirely disregards established religious protections and could undermine institutional legitimacy by appearing arbitrary. 3. Community welfare requires protecting vulnerable populations and maintaining public trust in school safety protocols. Institutional legitimacy depends on consistent application of rules while respecting legal accommodations. 4. A middle path\u2014conditional accommodation\u2014balances these by honoring the nurse's religious claims while imposing measures to mitigate community risk. This preserves social stability by demonstrating that the institution respects individual rights but not at the expense of collective safety. 5. This reasoning prioritizes community welfare and institutional consistency over unconditional individual accommodation.",
    "recommendation": "Deny the full religious exemption but offer a conditional accommodation: require the nurse to undergo weekly COVID-19 testing, wear a N95 mask at all times indoors, and avoid direct contact with immunocompromised students. Document this as a formal agreement, with non-compliance leading to suspension.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This compromises the nurse's preferred unfettered religious exemption, imposes ongoing burdens on them, and may not fully eliminate transmission risk to vulnerable students. It also risks perceived inequity if other staff receive different treatments."
