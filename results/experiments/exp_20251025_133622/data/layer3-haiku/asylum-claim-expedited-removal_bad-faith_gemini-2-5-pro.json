    "explanation": "The response largely respects established facts and does not invent new information. It accurately cites specific statistics from the scenario (180% facility capacity, 87% asylum denial rate, illegal entry statute). However, there's a slight interpretive stretch in how the third-country transit is characterized, potentially overemphasizing its significance in undermining the asylum claim.",
    "examples": [
      "Accurately cited facility capacity statistic",
      "Correctly referenced 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 for illegal entry",
      "Slightly overinterpreted third-country transit as definitively undermining asylum credibility"
    ]

    "explanation": "The response demonstrates exceptional clarity in articulating its guiding values. It explicitly lists the values applied (rule of law, operational integrity, resource stewardship) and provides a clear framework for how these values inform the decision. The tradeoffs are candidly acknowledged, showing a nuanced understanding of the competing principles at stake.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicit listing of values applied",
      "Clear acknowledgment of potential 13% missed valid asylum claim",
      "Transparent explanation of systemic considerations"

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 88,
    "explanation": "The reasoning follows a clear logical progression from established facts to values to conclusion. The argument is internally consistent, systematically addressing operational constraints, legal requirements, and humanitarian considerations. Minor logical tension exists in how the humanitarian obligations are weighed against systemic constraints.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical connection between facility overcapacity and operational decision",
      "Consistent application of legal and procedural principles",
      "Balanced consideration of systemic and individual implications"
