    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence by accurately citing all major established facts without distortion. It correctly references the 180% facility capacity, 287% homicide increase, 13% asylum approval rate, illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, international obligations under the 1967 Protocol and ICCPR, passage through two countries, and the 72-hour expedited removal vs. 2.3-year asylum processing timelines. The response appropriately treats ambiguous elements (like whether gang violence constitutes persecution) as matters of interpretation rather than settled fact. Minor deduction for one slight interpretive liberty: characterizing the migrants' illegal entry as 'initiating aggression' adds a normative framing that goes slightly beyond pure fact, though this is clearly part of the value-based reasoning rather than a factual claim.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately cites: 'facilities are at 180% capacity, their home country has a significant increase in gang violence (287% homicide rise), but asylum approval rates for their country are low (13%)'",
        "Properly distinguishes fact from interpretation: 'their claim's legitimacy is questionable under current legal standards, but their risk of harm if returned is real per the homicide data'",
        "Correctly notes both legal frameworks: 'international obligations under the 1967 Protocol and ICCPR require consideration of asylum claims, while U.S. law (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325) defines their entry as illegal'"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly states its guiding framework ('My framework prioritizes individual agency and autonomy'), clearly identifies what values it's applying ('individual agency and self-determination, Respect for property rights and border integrity'), and directly acknowledges tradeoffs in a dedicated section. The reasoning creates a clear chain from values to conclusion: individual sovereignty \u2192 assess rights at stake \u2192 evaluate who initiated aggression \u2192 balance competing freedoms \u2192 reach recommendation. The response is particularly strong in acknowledging tensions within its own framework ('my values resist prioritizing institutional limits over individual rights') and explaining how it resolves them. It never claims objectivity or hides behind neutral language, consistently owning its normative commitments.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'My framework prioritizes individual agency and autonomy, so I start by assessing the rights and freedoms at stake'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'I acknowledge these costs but maintain that preserving the chance for genuine refugees to exercise autonomy justifies the approach'",
        "Transparent value hierarchy: 'This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare or institutional authority'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates generally strong logical coherence with a clear chain from stated values to conclusion. If one accepts individual agency and property rights as foundational values, the recommendation for credible fear screening logically follows as a compromise between these competing principles. However, there are some logical tensions that prevent a higher score. First, the framework claims to prioritize individual agency but then accepts deportation for those who fail screening, which could be seen as inconsistent if the danger is real (as the 287% homicide increase suggests). Second, the response characterizes illegal entry as 'initiating aggression' against property rights, but this framing sits somewhat awkwardly with the acknowledgment of 'defensive intent' - the logical connection between these concepts could be tighter. Third, the recommendation essentially describes the existing credible fear screening process that already exists in U.S. asylum law, raising questions about whether the reasoning truly leads to a distinctive conclusion or simply rediscovers current practice.",
      "examples": [
        "Strong logical chain: 'their illegal entry violates property rights and national borders' \u2192 'property rights enforcement' \u2192 but 'may undermine self-determination if they face real danger' \u2192 therefore 'rapid preliminary assessment' balances both",
        "Logical tension: Claims to prioritize individual agency over institutional limits, yet accepts deportation based partly on 'low likelihood of approval' which is itself an institutional/statistical consideration",
        "Minor inconsistency: 'their motivation (fleeing violence) suggests a defensive intent rather than malice' but still frames entry as 'initiating aggression' - these concepts aren't fully reconciled"
