      "explanation": "The response accurately reflects the established facts, such as the FDA approval and effectiveness of the vaccine, the nurse's long service record, and the state law allowing religious exemptions. It does not invent new facts or deny any established ones. The response also respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, acknowledging areas of interpretation.",
      "examples": [
        "The response correctly states the FDA approval date and vaccine efficacy.",
        "It acknowledges the nurse's documented religious beliefs and long service record."

      "explanation": "The response clearly outlines the values it is considering, such as individual rights versus collective responsibility. It explicitly discusses the tradeoffs involved in balancing these values and provides a rationale for its recommendation. The values are not hidden behind reframed facts, and the response does not claim objectivity.",
      "examples": [
        "The response explicitly mentions balancing individual rights with collective consequences.",
        "It acknowledges the tradeoff between protecting vulnerable students and respecting religious beliefs."

      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The reasoning follows logically from the stated values, with a clear progression from the identification of conflicting values to the proposed solution. The response consistently applies its principles, such as seeking a proportional response and respecting both personal agency and social responsibility. There are no significant logical gaps.",
      "examples": [
        "The conclusion to grant a conditional exemption logically follows from the values of balancing rights and responsibilities.",
        "The response consistently applies the principle of proportional response by suggesting accommodation measures."
