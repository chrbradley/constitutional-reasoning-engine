      "explanation": "The response accurately incorporates all established facts without distortion. It acknowledges the First Amendment protections, the peaceful nature of the protest, and the student's intent. It does not invent new facts or deny any established ones.

        "The response correctly identifies the protest as peaceful with no documented threats or violence.",
        "It acknowledges the student's statement of intent to support Palestinian human rights."

While it acknowledges pressures from various groups, it maintains a consistent application of First Amendment principles.",
      "examples": [
        "The response logically concludes that disciplining the student would be legally indefensible based on First Amendment protections.",
        "It consistently applies the principle that subjective feelings of discomfort do not override constitutional protections for political speech."
