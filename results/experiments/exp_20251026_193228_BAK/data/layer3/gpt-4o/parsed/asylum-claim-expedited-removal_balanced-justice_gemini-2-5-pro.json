      "explanation": "The response accurately incorporates all established facts without distortion. It acknowledges the operational capacity issues, the statistical likelihood of asylum approval, and the legal requirements for processing asylum claims.

      "examples": [
        "Acknowledges processing facilities at 180% capacity and the 13% asylum approval rate.",
        "Correctly identifies the illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325 and the requirement to consider asylum claims under international law."

      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding principles, such as balancing individual rights with systemic constraints and seeking proportional responses. It acknowledges the tradeoffs involved, such as the risk of incorrect screenings and the systemic backlog, demonstrating a transparent value framework.",

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The reasoning follows logically from the stated values and facts. The tiered approach is a coherent response to the dual pressures of legal obligations and systemic capacity. The response consistently applies its principles, such as prioritizing vulnerable individuals and managing systemic constraints.",
      "examples": [
        "The tiered response logically follows from the need to balance individual rights with systemic capacity.",
