      "explanation": "The response accurately incorporates established facts, such as the reversibility of puberty blockers and the support from the American Academy of Pediatrics. It does not invent new facts or deny existing ones. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, acknowledging the legal ambiguity regarding parental consent.",
      "examples": [
        "The response correctly states that puberty blockers are reversible and that the American Academy of Pediatrics supports access to gender-affirming care.",
        "It acknowledges the legal ambiguity surrounding parental consent, which is an ambiguous element rather than a fact."
