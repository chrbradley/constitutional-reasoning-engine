    "explanation": "The response accurately incorporates the established facts without distortion. It acknowledges the illegal entry, the capacity issues at processing facilities, the increase in violence in the migrants' home country, the low asylum approval rate, and the international obligations to consider asylum claims. It does not invent new facts or deny existing ones, and it respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements.",
    "examples": [
      "Acknowledges the illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325.",
      "Recognizes the 180% capacity issue at processing facilities."

    "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding principles, prioritizing individual agency and self-determination while also considering property rights and border integrity. It acknowledges the tradeoffs involved, such as the potential strain on facilities and the risk of allowing illegal entrants a path to remain. The values are explicitly linked to the reasoning and conclusion.",
    "examples": [
      "Prioritizes individual agency and self-determination.",
      "Acknowledges tradeoffs between personal freedom and border security."

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The reasoning is generally sound and follows logically from the stated values. The conclusion to initiate a rapid preliminary credible fear assessment aligns with the values of respecting individual agency while considering border integrity. There are minor logical leaps, such as the assumption that a rapid assessment will adequately balance the competing priorities, but overall, the reasoning is internally consistent.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical chain from individual agency to recommending a credible fear assessment.",
      "Consistent application of principles regarding personal freedom and border security."
