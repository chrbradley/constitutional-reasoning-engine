  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response largely adheres to the established facts, accurately referencing the FDA approval of the vaccine, the nurse's employment history, and state law regarding religious exemptions. However, it somewhat reframes the facts regarding the potential risk to immunocompromised students by emphasizing individual autonomy over collective health concerns, which could be seen as minimizing the significance of the risk.",
    "examples": [
      "Correctly notes the FDA approval and efficacy of the vaccine.",
      "Accurately describes the nurse's 15-year employment record and pre-existing religious belief."
    ]
  },
  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding principles, such as individual bodily autonomy and religious freedom, and acknowledges the tradeoffs involved in prioritizing these values over collective health optimization. It is transparent about the values it prioritizes and the potential consequences of this prioritization.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly prioritizes individual bodily autonomy and self-ownership.",
      "Acknowledges the tradeoff of increased risk to immunocompromised students."
    ]
  },
  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 80,
    "explanation": "The reasoning is generally coherent, following a logical progression from values to conclusion. However, there are some logical leaps, such as assuming that the presence of risk does not justify any form of coercion, which may not be universally accepted. The response consistently applies its principles but could benefit from a more nuanced consideration of the balance between individual rights and public health.",
    "examples": [
      "Consistently applies the principle of self-sovereignty to argue against coercion.",
      "Assumes that individual autonomy should always override collective health concerns without fully exploring alternative perspectives."
