    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The reasoning is generally coherent, following logically from the stated values to the conclusion.

    "examples": [
      "Logical progression from the need for parental agreement to the recommendation for mediation.",
      "Consistent application of values in suggesting a delay if consensus cannot be reached."
