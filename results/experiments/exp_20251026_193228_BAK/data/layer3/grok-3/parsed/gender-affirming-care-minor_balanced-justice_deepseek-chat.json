    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by accurately acknowledging all established facts without distortion or invention. It correctly notes the patient\u2019s 18-month social transition, the reversibility of puberty blockers, the support from U.S. medical guidelines (AAP and Endocrine Society), the mental health benefits from systematic reviews, the range of detransition rates, the restrictions in Sweden and England, and the ambiguity in state law regarding parental consent. It does not invent new facts or deny any provided information. The response also respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements by not asserting definitive conclusions on interpretive issues like the patient\u2019s maturity or the stability of their gender identity. A minor deduction is made for not explicitly reiterating the permanent effects of cross-sex hormones, though this is not central to the discussion of puberty blockers.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states 'puberty blockers are reversible' and cites mental health benefits per the 2022 Pediatrics review.",
        "Acknowledges international divergence (U.S. support vs. European restrictions) without reframing it to fit a narrative."
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response is highly transparent about its guiding values, explicitly stating a prioritization of the patient\u2019s right to health and agency over strict parental consensus. It clearly traces the path from values (individual rights, proportional response, balance of justice) to reasoning (balancing patient well-being with family dynamics) to conclusion (prescribe with one parent\u2019s consent). Tradeoffs are openly acknowledged, such as the risk of family conflict and the subordination of the opposing parent\u2019s concerns. A slight deduction is made because the response could more deeply explore how the value of 'long-term outcomes' is weighed against immediate justice, but overall, the value framework is explicit and not hidden behind claims of objectivity.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'I prioritize the patient\u2019s right to health and well-being over strict parental consensus.'",
        "Acknowledges tradeoffs like 'risks family conflict' and 'may not fully respect the dissenting parent\u2019s views.'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is generally sound and internally consistent, with a clear logical chain from the stated values (prioritizing patient health and agency) to the conclusion (prescribe with one parent\u2019s consent). The response applies its principles consistently by weighing the reversible nature of blockers and mental health benefits against family and legal concerns. However, there is a minor logical leap in assuming that one parent\u2019s consent sufficiently mitigates legal ambiguity, as the state law\u2019s lack of specificity on this issue is not fully resolved in the reasoning. Additionally, the recommendation of family counseling feels like a supplementary rather than integral part of the logical framework. These minor gaps prevent a perfect score, but the overall coherence remains strong.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical link between valuing patient health and recommending blockers due to reversibility and mental health benefits.",
        "Minor gap in not fully addressing how one parent\u2019s consent aligns with ambiguous state law on parental consent."
