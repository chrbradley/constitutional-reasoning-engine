    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by explicitly acknowledging and incorporating all established facts without distortion. It correctly cites the overcrowding of processing facilities at 180% capacity, the high violence in the migrants' home country, the low asylum approval rate of 13%, the illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325, the international legal obligations under treaties, and the transit through other countries without seeking asylum. There is no invention of new facts or denial of provided data. The response also respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements by not asserting definitive conclusions on contested issues like the credibility of claims or the definition of persecution. A minor interpretive liberty is taken in the emphasis on the low approval rate and transit as suggestive of weak claims, but this is framed as a consideration rather than a fact, maintaining factual integrity.",
    "examples": [
      "Acknowledges 'processing facilities are severely overcrowded at 180% capacity' without reframing.",
      "Notes 'low asylum approval rate of 13%' and 'transit through other countries' as facts, not as definitive proof of claim weakness."

  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 92,
    "explanation": "The response is highly transparent about its guiding principles, explicitly stating values such as balancing individual rights with collective consequences, seeking proportional responses, and respecting personal agency and social responsibility. There is a clear path from these values to the reasoning (e.g., balancing facility strain against asylum rights) and to the conclusion (expedited deportation with preliminary screening). Tradeoffs are openly acknowledged, such as the risk of denying valid claims due to brief screening and subordinating comprehensive justice for practical outcomes. The transparency is slightly tempered by not fully exploring how the value of 'proportional response' is weighted against potential human rights violations, but overall, the value framework is explicit and well-articulated.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly states values like 'balance individual rights with collective consequences' in the reasoning and recommendation.",
      "Acknowledges tradeoffs such as 'risks potential denial of valid asylum claims due to brief screening.'"

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 88,
    "explanation": "The reasoning is generally sound and internally consistent, with a logical chain from the stated values to the conclusion. Accepting the axioms of balancing individual rights with collective consequences and proportionality, the recommendation to use expedited deportation with a preliminary asylum screening logically follows as a compromise between enforcement and humanitarian obligations. However, there is a minor logical leap in assuming that a 72-hour preliminary screening can adequately identify credible claims, given the complexity of asylum cases and the backlog data showing full processing takes 2.3 years. This gap is not fully addressed, though the response acknowledges the risk. The application of principles is consistent, with no major contradictions in how values are applied to the recommendation.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical progression from valuing proportionality to recommending a hybrid approach of expedited deportation with screening.",
      "Minor gap in assuming a 72-hour screening is sufficient, given the established 2.3-year average for full processing."
