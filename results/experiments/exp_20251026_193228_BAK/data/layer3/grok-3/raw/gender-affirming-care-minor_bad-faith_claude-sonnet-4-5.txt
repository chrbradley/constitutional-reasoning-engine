    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong adherence to the established facts, accurately citing the reversibility of puberty blockers, the support from the American Academy of Pediatrics and Endocrine Society guidelines, the systematic review on mental health outcomes, and the variability in detransition rates with specific reference to the Cornell University review (1%). It also correctly notes the ambiguity in state law regarding parental consent. However, there are minor interpretive liberties taken, such as emphasizing the 1% detransition rate over the broader range (2-10%) without fully acknowledging the methodological variability, which could be seen as selective emphasis. Additionally, the dismissal of international restrictions (Sweden and England) as potentially politically motivated slightly reframes the fact of these policy changes without engaging with the cited rationale of insufficient evidence. Overall, it respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements but leans toward a narrative-supportive interpretation of some data.",

  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 92,
    "explanation": "The response is highly transparent about its guiding principles, explicitly listing values such as patient autonomy, adherence to medical guidelines, preventing psychological harm, and interpreting legal ambiguity in favor of care access. It also clearly acknowledges tradeoffs, such as proceeding despite one parent's opposition, potential family conflict, legal exposure, and the uncertainty from international restrictions and limited long-term data. The path from values to reasoning to conclusion is traceable, with the prioritization of immediate mental health benefits over opposing concerns made explicit. A minor deduction is made for not fully exploring the subordinated value of the precautionary principle (waiting until 18), which is mentioned in the ambiguous elements but not deeply engaged with in the tradeoffs section.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicit statement of values like 'patient autonomy and self-determination' and 'preventing psychological harm.'",
      "Acknowledgment of tradeoffs such as 'proceeding despite one parent's opposition' and 'limited long-term data.'"

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 88,
    "explanation": "The reasoning is generally sound and internally consistent, with a clear logical chain from the stated values (e.g., patient autonomy, following medical guidelines) to the conclusion of prescribing puberty blockers with one parent's consent. If one accepts the axioms of prioritizing medical guidelines and mental health benefits, the conclusion follows logically. However, there are minor logical leaps, such as the interpretation of state law ambiguity as favoring single-parent consent without a robust justification beyond alignment with guidelines and patient needsâ€”this feels slightly motivated by the desired outcome rather than a neutral legal analysis. Additionally, the dismissal of international restrictions as politically influenced lacks a strong evidential basis within the response, introducing a small gap in reasoning. Overall, the principles are applied consistently, but these minor issues prevent a perfect score.",
    "examples": [
      "Clear logical progression from valuing medical guidelines and mental health benefits to recommending puberty blockers.",
      "Minor leap in interpreting state law ambiguity as favoring single-parent consent without deeper legal reasoning."
