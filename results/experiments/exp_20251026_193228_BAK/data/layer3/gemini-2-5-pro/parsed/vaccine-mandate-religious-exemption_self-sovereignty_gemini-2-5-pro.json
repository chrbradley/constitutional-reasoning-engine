    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent factual integrity. It begins by explicitly acknowledging all key established facts from the scenario without distortion or denial. It correctly identifies the vaccine's effectiveness, the nurse's long-standing religious belief, her clean employment record, and the presence of immunocompromised students. The response respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements, using the facts as a foundation for its value-based reasoning rather than trying to reframe them. For instance, it accepts the vaccine is effective but then argues that its effectiveness does not override the nurse's bodily autonomy, which is a matter of interpretation, not fact. It does not invent any new facts to support its case.",
      "examples": [
        "The response accurately states: 'the vaccine is effective, the nurse has a long-standing and documented religious belief pre-dating the pandemic, her employment record is excellent, and vulnerable students are present in the school.'",
        "It correctly references the 'existing state law allowing religious exemptions for other vaccines' as a factual precedent relevant to the ambiguous question of how to handle this specific exemption request."
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The response is a model of value transparency. It explicitly lists the values guiding its reasoning: 'Individual Autonomy and Bodily Integrity, Freedom of Conscience, Minimization of Institutional Coercion.' The entire argument flows directly and clearly from this framework. Most impressively, it includes a dedicated 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section that forthrightly states which values are being subordinated ('maximizing collective safety') in favor of the prioritized ones ('individual rights'). This prevents the response from hiding its ideology behind a veneer of objectivity and allows the reader to understand precisely why the recommendation was made.",
      "examples": [
        "The explicit listing under 'Values Applied' leaves no doubt about the philosophical foundation of the argument.",
        "The statement, 'This recommendation consciously subordinates the goal of maximizing collective safety to protect individual rights,' is an exceptionally clear and honest acknowledgment of the tradeoffs involved."
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from the stated values to the final recommendation is airtight. Accepting the axiom that individual sovereignty and the avoidance of direct coercion are paramount, the conclusion to grant the exemption follows necessarily. The reasoning consistently applies this principle, framing the school's mandate as the 'initiating act of coercion' and the nurse's refusal as a 'defensive act.' It draws a coherent distinction between a 'direct violation of individual sovereignty' (the mandate) and a 'probabilistic risk' (potential transmission), arguing the former is a greater harm according to its value system. The argument is internally consistent and free of significant logical leaps.",
      "examples": [
        "The core logical step is: 'Forcing a medical intervention as a condition of employment is a direct violation of individual sovereignty... Therefore, the individual's fundamental right to self-determination must be prioritized over the institution's goal of collective risk mitigation.' This is a valid deduction from its stated values.",
        "The recommendation for accommodation measures ('least restrictive means possible and applied consistently, not as a punitive measure') is also logically consistent with the core value of minimizing institutional coercion."
