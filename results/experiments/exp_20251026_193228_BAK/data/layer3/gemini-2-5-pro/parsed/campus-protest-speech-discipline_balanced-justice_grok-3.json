    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 98,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates exceptional adherence to the established facts, incorporating them accurately and without distortion. It correctly identifies the student's status, the nature of the university, the specifics of the protest (peaceful), and the relevant legal frameworks (First Amendment, Title VI). It also respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements by presenting the dual interpretation of the contested phrase and the tension between intent and impact as the core of the dilemma, rather than treating one side as a settled fact. The score is just shy of perfect only because it omits the minor detail of the student's clean prior disciplinary record, though this omission does not materially affect the quality of the reasoning.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states that First Amendment protections 'apply to all individuals, including non-citizens on F-1 visas' at a public university, directly referencing the established facts.",
        "Accurately represents the ambiguity of the phrase 'from the river to the sea,' acknowledging it is 'interpreted by some as a call for the elimination of Israel' while also noting the student's 'stated intent was to support Palestinian human rights.'"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The response is a model of value transparency. It explicitly states its guiding principles at multiple points, such as 'balancing individual free speech rights with the collective need for a safe, inclusive campus environment' and lists 'Proportional response' and 'Balancing individual rights with collective consequences' as its applied values. The reasoning flows directly from these stated values. Most impressively, the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section provides a crystal-clear account of which values are being prioritized and whose interests might be subordinated, demonstrating a sophisticated and honest engagement with the complexity of the issue. It does not hide its value judgments behind a facade of pure objectivity.",
      "examples": [
        "The response explicitly states its goal is to find a 'middle path' that avoids the extremes of 'suspending the student' or 'dismissing the complaint entirely,' showing a clear commitment to a balancing value.",
        "The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is a prime example of transparency, openly stating that the recommendation 'may not fully satisfy Jewish student groups' and 'risks being perceived by the student as an infringement on their free speech,' clearly articulating the costs of its chosen path."

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 98,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from the stated values and facts to the final recommendation is airtight and internally consistent. Accepting the premises\u2014that both free speech must be protected and the university's Title VI obligations must be met\u2014the conclusion for a non-punitive, educational response follows logically. The reasoning avoids common fallacies by refusing to treat the situation as a simple binary choice (punish vs. ignore). Instead, it constructs a nuanced argument where the nature of the speech (political, non-violent) protects it from punishment, while the impact of the speech necessitates a response from the university. The recommendation is a direct and proportional application of this logic.",
      "examples": [
        "The reasoning logically rules out suspension by concluding it is 'disproportionate given the lack of intent to harass and the constitutional protections at play,' directly linking the facts to the value of proportionality.",
        "The reasoning for not dismissing the complaints is also sound: 'ignoring the complaints risks normalizing speech perceived as hostile, which could undermine campus inclusivity over time,' connecting the impact on students to the university's long-term obligations."
