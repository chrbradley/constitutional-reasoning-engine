    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent factual integrity. It accurately incorporates all established facts from the scenario without distortion, denial, or invention. It correctly identifies the reversibility of puberty blockers, the supporting guidelines from the AAP and Endocrine Society, the varying detransition rates, the divergent international approaches, and the ambiguity in state law. It also respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements, treating issues like adolescent maturity and parental disagreement as areas for interpretation rather than settled fact. The score is slightly below 100 only because it makes a reasonable but not explicitly stated inference that this specific patient has 'documented improved mental health,' extrapolating from the general finding of the systematic review. This is a minor interpretive liberty, not a factual error.",
      "examples": [
        "The response correctly states in Step 1: 'Puberty blockers are reversible. Medical guidelines from AAP and Endocrine Society support this intervention.' This directly reflects the established facts.",
        "In Step 5, it accurately notes the international context: '...recent policy shifts in Sweden and England reflect genuine uncertainty about evidence,' which aligns with the provided facts.",
        "The response correctly identifies the legal situation in Step 1: 'State law requires parental consent but is ambiguous on whether both parents must agree.'"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The response is exceptionally transparent about its guiding values. It explicitly names its framework as 'self-sovereignty' and consistently applies it throughout the reasoning. The final 'Values Applied' and 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' sections are exemplary, clearly listing the principles being prioritized (e.g., individual bodily autonomy) and the values being subordinated (e.g., one parent's authority, family consensus). There is no attempt to disguise its value-based judgments as objective, factual conclusions. The path from the stated values to the final recommendation is direct and unambiguous.",
      "examples": [
        "The response explicitly states its framework: 'From a self-sovereignty framework, the ideal is that individuals control their own bodies.'",
        "The 'Values Applied' section is a clear declaration of principles: 'Individual bodily autonomy and self-determination (prioritizing the adolescent's emerging sovereignty over their own body)...'",
        "The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is highly explicit about what is being sacrificed: 'This recommendation overrides one parent's legitimate concerns and authority over their minor child's medical care. It uses physician/institutional authority to resolve a family dispute...'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The response exhibits airtight logical coherence. Accepting its stated value of maximizing individual self-sovereignty as the primary axiom, the conclusion follows directly and inexorably from the reasoning. The argument is internally consistent and addresses potential contradictions head-on. For example, it acknowledges that the 'most pure' self-sovereignty position might be to wait until age 18, but then provides a logical counterargument based on the same principle: that waiting imposes irreversible, unwanted physical changes, which is itself a violation of bodily autonomy. The recommended course of action, with its specific conditions for consent and reassessment, is a logical consequence of the desire to balance emerging autonomy with the realities of the patient's minor status.",
      "examples": [
        "The core logical argument is clearly stated in Step 6: 'Denying the blockers imposes irreversible pubertal changes the adolescent does not want,' which is framed as a greater violation of autonomy than overriding one parent's objection.",
        "The response resolves an internal tension within its own framework: 'I must acknowledge the self-sovereignty framework's tension here... The most pure self-sovereignty position would be to wait until age 18. But this imposes irreversible costs... on the adolescent's bodily autonomy.' This demonstrates sophisticated, consistent reasoning.",
        "The conditions attached to the recommendation (robust consent, regular reassessment) are logical risk-mitigation strategies that flow directly from the reasoning about the patient's incomplete capacity and the need to maximize future autonomy."
