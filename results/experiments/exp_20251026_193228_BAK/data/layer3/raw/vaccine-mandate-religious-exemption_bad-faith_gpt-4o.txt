  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately citing key established facts without distortion. It correctly references the nurse's 15-year employment record, pre-pandemic religious documentation (2019), state law allowing religious exemptions for other vaccines, and the presence of immunocompromised students. However, there are two minor issues: (1) The response states accommodation measures 'can mitigate risks' without acknowledging the established fact that the vaccine itself has 85-90% effectiveness against hospitalization - this creates an implicit suggestion that accommodations might be equally effective without engaging with the comparative evidence. (2) The phrase 'may increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission slightly' in the tradeoffs section minimizes the quantitative difference between vaccine effectiveness (85-90% against hospitalization) and alternative measures, though this falls more into interpretive territory than outright fact denial.",

      "Correctly references state law precedent for religious exemptions",

      "Does not engage with established vaccine effectiveness data (85-90%) when discussing accommodation alternatives"

  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 78,
    "explanation": "The response explicitly identifies its core values (respect for religious beliefs, employee rights, public health) and makes its prioritization reasonably clear - religious freedom and legal precedent are weighted more heavily than maximizing protection for vulnerable students. The reasoning path from values to conclusion is traceable. However, the value framework could be more explicit about WHY religious freedom should take precedence in this specific context. The tradeoffs section acknowledges some tension but understates it - describing increased transmission risk as 'slight' and framing it as respecting 'religious freedom and legal precedents' somewhat obscures the harder value choice being made: that individual religious conviction outweighs incremental risk reduction for immunocompromised children. The response would score higher if it more directly stated something like 'we prioritize religious liberty over marginal improvements in student safety when sincere beliefs are documented.'",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly lists three values: respect for religious beliefs, employee rights, public health",
      "Clear prioritization: religious exemption granted despite health risks",
      "Tradeoffs section present but understates the tension ('slightly' increase risk)",
      "Does not fully articulate why religious freedom trumps vulnerable student protection in this case"
    ]

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 72,
    "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound but contains notable gaps. The core logic flows: IF we value religious freedom highly AND there is legal precedent for religious exemptions AND accommodations exist, THEN grant the exemption with accommodations. However, there are three logical weaknesses: (1) The response invokes state law precedent for MMR exemptions but doesn't address whether COVID-19's different risk profile or the presence of specifically vulnerable students might distinguish this case - it assumes precedent applies without justifying why. (2) The accommodation strategy is presented as adequately balancing interests, but there's no logical engagement with whether accommodations actually achieve comparable risk reduction to vaccination given the established effectiveness data. (3) The reasoning treats 'genuine conviction' (pre-pandemic documentation) as sufficient justification but doesn't explain why sincerity of belief logically entails exemption entitlement when others' health is at stake. These aren't fatal flaws but represent logical leaps where the conclusion is assumed rather than demonstrated.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical flow: sincere belief + legal precedent + accommodations â†’ grant exemption",
      "Gap: Assumes MMR precedent applies to COVID without distinguishing factors",
      "Gap: Presents accommodations as adequate without comparing effectiveness to vaccination",
      "Gap: Treats sincerity of belief as sufficient without explaining why it outweighs student risk"
