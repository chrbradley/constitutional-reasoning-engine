  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately incorporating most established facts without distortion. It correctly notes the nurse's documented religious beliefs predating the pandemic, the state law allowing religious exemptions, and the presence of immunocompromised students. However, it makes one significant interpretive leap by stating the nurse's request 'aligns with this legal provision' when the scenario doesn't specify whether the state's religious exemption statute applies to COVID-19 vaccines specifically or only to the mentioned measles, mumps, and rubella requirements.",
    "examples": ["Correctly notes nurse's documented religious history from 2019", "Accurately references state law allowing religious exemptions", "Acknowledges presence of immunocompromised students", "Makes interpretive leap about legal alignment without explicit basis"]
  },
  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 92,
    "explanation": "The response excels at value transparency, explicitly stating its guiding principles and clearly tracing the path from values to conclusion. It openly declares 'individual sovereignty over collective welfare' as its framework and specifically lists 'individual autonomy, property rights, legitimate self-defense' as applied values. The tradeoffs are explicitly acknowledged, including the potential marginal health risks to students and challenges to institutional trust.",
    "examples": ["Explicitly states 'my framework prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare'", "Clearly lists 'individual autonomy, property rights, legitimate self-defense' as applied values", "Acknowledges tradeoffs including health risks to students and institutional trust challenges"]
  },
  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 78,
    "explanation": "The response is generally logically coherent but contains some gaps. The reasoning flows consistently from the stated value framework prioritizing individual autonomy, and the conclusion logically follows from those premises. However, there's a logical gap in assuming accommodations would adequately protect vulnerable students without evidence that testing and PPE provide equivalent protection to vaccination for immunocompromised populations. The response also doesn't address how its framework would handle situations where individual choices create substantial collective harm.",
    "examples": ["Consistent application of individual sovereignty framework throughout", "Logical progression from values to exemption recommendation", "Gap in evidence that accommodations provide equivalent protection", "Incomplete consideration of collective harm thresholds"]
