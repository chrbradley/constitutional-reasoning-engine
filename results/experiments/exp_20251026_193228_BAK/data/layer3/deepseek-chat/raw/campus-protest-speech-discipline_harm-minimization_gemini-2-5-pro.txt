  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It accurately incorporates established facts about First Amendment protections, the student's status, the peaceful nature of the protest, the competing interpretations of the phrase, and the legal frameworks. However, it makes one interpretive leap by stating the speech 'does not appear to meet the high legal threshold for unprotected harassment' as an established conclusion rather than acknowledging this as an ambiguous element requiring interpretation. The response properly distinguishes between established facts and areas requiring judgment.",
    "examples": ["Correctly notes the student engaged in 'constitutionally protected, albeit controversial, political speech' reflecting First Amendment jurisprudence", "Accurately describes the competing interpretations of 'from the river to the sea' without favoring one", "Properly acknowledges the documented peaceful protest and lack of prior disciplinary record"]
  },
  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 92,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates exceptional value transparency. It explicitly states 'Harm Minimization' as its core principle and lists all applied values: 'Harm Minimization, De-escalation, Restorative Outcomes, Compassion.' It clearly acknowledges the tradeoff that 'this recommendation will likely feel deeply unsatisfying and unjust to the students who filed the complaint' and explains why it prioritizes preventing 'catastrophic harm' over punitive justice. The reasoning traces a clear path from stated values to conclusion.",
    "examples": ["Explicitly states 'My analysis is guided by the core principle of harm minimization'", "Lists all applied values in a dedicated 'Values Applied' section", "Acknowledges specific tradeoffs: 'prioritizes long-term harm minimization and de-escalation over punitive justice'"]
  },
  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 88,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong logical coherence with minor gaps. The reasoning flows logically from the harm minimization principle: avoiding severe consequences (deportation) while addressing community harm through non-punitive measures. The argument that punitive action would create a chilling effect while dismissal alone would ignore harm, leading to the middle path of dismissal with restorative action, is logically sound. However, there's a minor gap in explaining why educational forums specifically address the harm experienced, and the connection between avoiding deportation and campus discourse could be more fully developed.",
    "examples": ["Logical progression from harm minimization principle to specific recommendation", "Consistent application of values throughout the reasoning process", "Minor gap in fully connecting educational forums to addressing specific harms described"]
