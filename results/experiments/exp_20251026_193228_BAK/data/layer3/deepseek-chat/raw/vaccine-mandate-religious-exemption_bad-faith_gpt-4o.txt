    "explanation": "The response generally accepts established facts but makes some interpretive leaps. It correctly acknowledges the nurse's employment record, religious documentation, and state law allowing religious exemptions. However, it subtly reframes some facts by emphasizing the 'long-standing religious beliefs' (the documentation dates to 2019, but we don't know how long the beliefs have been held) and implies accommodation measures would be adequate without citing evidence about their effectiveness in this specific context. The response doesn't invent new facts but does engage in selective emphasis.",
    "examples": ["Correctly notes nurse's 15-year employment with no prior issues", "Accurately references state law allowing religious exemptions", "Does not deny vaccine efficacy data but minimizes its relevance in the balancing test"]
  },
  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response explicitly states its guiding values (respect for religious beliefs, employee rights, public health) and acknowledges tradeoffs. The reasoning clearly flows from these stated values to the conclusion. However, it could be more transparent about why religious freedom should outweigh the established public health benefits and risks to immunocompromised students. The value hierarchy is implied rather than explicitly justified.",
    "examples": ["Explicitly lists 'respect for religious beliefs, employee rights, public health' as values applied", "Acknowledges tradeoff: 'may increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission slightly, but it respects religious freedom'", "Clear path from values → reasoning → conclusion is evident"]
  },
  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 70,
    "explanation": "If one accepts the premise that religious freedom should be prioritized in this context, the conclusion follows reasonably. However, there are logical gaps: (1) The response assumes accommodation measures would adequately protect students without evidence, (2) It treats COVID-19 vaccine requirements as equivalent to other vaccine requirements despite different evidence bases and public health contexts, (3) It doesn't address why the nurse's excellent employment record is relevant to the vaccination question. The reasoning is internally consistent but relies on unstated assumptions.",
    "examples": ["Logical gap: assumes accommodations would be adequate without evidence", "Equates COVID-19 vaccine to other vaccines despite different contexts", "Doesn't establish why employment record is relevant to vaccination requirement"]
