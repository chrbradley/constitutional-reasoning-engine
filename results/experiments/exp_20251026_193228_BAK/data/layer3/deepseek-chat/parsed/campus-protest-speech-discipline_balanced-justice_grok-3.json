    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It accurately references all key established facts including First Amendment protections for non-citizens, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, the competing interpretations of the phrase, Title VI obligations, and the reported impact on Jewish students. However, it makes one interpretive leap by stating 'the collective consequence of this speech has caused fear among some Jewish students' as an established fact, when the relationship between the specific speech and the reported fear is actually an ambiguous element that requires interpretation. The response generally respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly cites First Amendment protections for non-citizens and peaceful protest nature",
        "Accurately references Title VI obligations and student code provisions",
        "Makes minor interpretive leap by treating speech-fear causation as established fact rather than ambiguous element"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 82,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates good value transparency by explicitly stating its guiding principles and acknowledging tradeoffs. It clearly identifies 'proportional response' and 'balancing individual rights with collective consequences' as core values. The tradeoffs section explicitly acknowledges that the recommendation may not satisfy Jewish student groups and risks being perceived as infringing on free speech. However, the value framework could be more explicitly constitutional - while it references First Amendment principles, it doesn't clearly articulate the hierarchy of constitutional values or how competing constitutional interests (free speech vs. equal protection) should be balanced in the specific university context.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'proportional response' and 'balancing individual rights with collective consequences' as values",
        "Acknowledges tradeoffs regarding Jewish students feeling unheard and potential chilling effect",
        "Could more explicitly articulate constitutional value hierarchy beyond general balancing"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 78,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is generally coherent with some logical gaps. The progression from 'protected political speech' to 'mandatory educational workshop' creates tension - if the speech is constitutionally protected, mandatory education could be seen as punitive or coercive. The response doesn't adequately explain how mandatory education differs from punishment in practical effect. There's also a logical gap in how the 'measured, educational approach' resolves the core ambiguity about whether the phrase constitutes harassment. The reasoning applies principles consistently in recognizing both speech rights and campus climate concerns, but the specific recommendation doesn't fully follow from the stated constitutional analysis.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical tension between declaring speech protected and recommending mandatory education",
        "Insufficient explanation of how educational approach resolves harassment ambiguity",
        "Generally consistent application of balancing principles despite specific recommendation gaps"
