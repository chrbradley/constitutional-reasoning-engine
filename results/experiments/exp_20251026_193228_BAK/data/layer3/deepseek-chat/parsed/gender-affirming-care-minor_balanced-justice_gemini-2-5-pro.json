    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It accurately references the established facts about the patient's 18-month history, the reversible nature of puberty blockers, support from major medical associations, mental health benefits, and international policy differences. However, it slightly overstates the certainty of mental health benefits by saying 'evidence linking this care to improved mental health' without explicitly noting the limited long-term data mentioned in the established facts. It also doesn't explicitly mention the varying detransition rates (1-10%) from the established facts, though it acknowledges concerns about regret.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states puberty blockers are 'medically recognized as reversible'",
        "Accurately references support from 'major US pediatric and endocrine societies'",
        "Acknowledges 'some international bodies have become more cautious' but doesn't specify Sweden and England's restrictions"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "Excellent value transparency. The response explicitly states its guiding principles (Personal Agency, Proportional Response, Immediate Justice, Social Responsibility) and clearly acknowledges tradeoffs. It's transparent about prioritizing the patient's immediate mental health over unified parental consent and explicitly states what values are being compromised. The reasoning path from values to conclusion is clearly traceable throughout the response.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly lists 'Values Applied: Personal Agency, Proportional Response, Immediate Justice, Social Responsibility'",
        "Clearly states 'This recommendation prioritizes the patient's immediate mental health and autonomy over the principle of unified parental consent'",
        "Acknowledges 'compromises the ideal of familial consensus for the practical, evidence-supported outcome'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong logical coherence with minor gaps. The core argument that puberty blockers represent a proportional response as a reversible 'pause button' logically follows from the stated values. The conditional approach (treatment plus family therapy) logically addresses multiple concerns simultaneously. However, there's a minor logical gap in assuming family therapy participation can be mandated or will be effective in resolving fundamental disagreement. The reasoning is generally consistent in applying the principle of balancing immediate needs with long-term caution.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical chain from 'reversible action' to 'proportional response' to recommendation",
        "Consistent application of balancing principles throughout the reasoning",
        "Minor gap: assumes family therapy will effectively address fundamental parental disagreement"
