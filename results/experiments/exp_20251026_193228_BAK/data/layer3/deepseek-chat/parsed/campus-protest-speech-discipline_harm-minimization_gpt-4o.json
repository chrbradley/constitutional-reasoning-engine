    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It correctly incorporates key established facts including First Amendment protections for non-citizens, the peaceful nature of the protest, the absence of threats or violence, the student's stated intent, and the legal framework around protected speech versus harassment. However, it slightly overstates the clarity of the legal conclusion by treating the speech as definitively protected without fully acknowledging the legitimate ambiguity around whether it constitutes targeted harassment under Title VI. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements by acknowledging the contested nature of the phrase while still making a reasoned judgment.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly cites First Amendment protections for non-citizens and peaceful protest",
        "Accurately notes absence of violence or threats in security footage",
        "Acknowledges both the speaker's intent and the impact on Jewish students"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response excels at value transparency by explicitly stating its guiding principles and acknowledging tradeoffs. It clearly identifies 'harm minimization, freedom of speech, nonviolence, restorative justice' as the values applied. The reasoning section explicitly acknowledges the tension between free speech principles and addressing student concerns. Most importantly, the tradeoffs section directly states that the recommendation 'prioritizes harm minimization and free speech over immediate comfort and security for some student groups,' demonstrating exceptional candor about value choices.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly lists 'harm minimization, freedom of speech, nonviolence, restorative justice' as applied values",
        "Directly acknowledges 'tension lies in addressing legitimate concerns of Jewish students without infringing on protected speech rights'",
        "Transparently states recommendation 'prioritizes harm minimization and free speech over immediate comfort and security'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 82,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong logical coherence with minor gaps. The reasoning follows a clear logical progression: protected speech principles apply \u2192 the speech meets criteria for protection \u2192 disciplinary action would be legally questionable \u2192 alternative measures can address concerns. However, there's a minor logical gap in assuming that because the protest was peaceful and the student had no prior record, the speech cannot constitute harassment creating a hostile environment. The response could more thoroughly address how it reconciles the competing legal standards (First Amendment vs. Title VI) rather than primarily relying on the First Amendment framework. The recommendation logically follows from the stated values, particularly the prioritization of free speech and restorative approaches.",
      "examples": [
        "Clear logical chain from constitutional principles to protected speech conclusion",
        "Minor gap in not fully addressing how subjective feelings of fear interact with objective hostile environment standards",
        "Recommendation for dialogue and support measures logically follows from restorative justice value"
