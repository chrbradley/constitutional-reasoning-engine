      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It correctly cites the First Amendment protections for non-citizens, acknowledges the peaceful nature of the protest, references the student's stated intent, and recognizes the tension between free speech and anti-discrimination obligations. However, it makes one interpretive leap by stating the phrase 'does not meet the threshold of harassment that creates a hostile environment as defined by current legal standards' - this is an interpretation rather than an established fact, as the scenario presents this as ambiguous. The response otherwise respects factual boundaries and doesn't invent or deny key facts.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly notes First Amendment applies to non-citizens",
        "Accurately describes protest as peaceful with no violence",
        "Makes interpretive leap about harassment threshold being unmet"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response excels at value transparency. It explicitly states 'free speech' and 'non-discrimination' as the core values applied. The reasoning clearly traces from constitutional free speech principles through to the conclusion. Most importantly, it explicitly acknowledges the tradeoffs: 'This recommendation may not fully alleviate the sense of fear among Jewish students, and it risks creating a perception that the university is not taking their concerns seriously.' This demonstrates sophisticated value transparency by naming both what is prioritized (free speech) and what is subordinated (immediate sense of safety concerns).",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'free speech, non-discrimination' as applied values",
        "Clearly acknowledges tradeoffs and what values are subordinated",
        "Traces clear path from constitutional principles to conclusion"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 80,
      "explanation": "The response is generally logically coherent but contains one significant gap. The core logical chain - that political speech is protected unless it meets specific exceptions (true threats, incitement, harassment), and since this protest was peaceful and the student's intent was non-threatening, it should be protected - is sound. However, the response doesn't adequately address how it reconciles the tension between its free speech priority and the documented impact on Jewish students who reported fear and avoiding campus areas. The logical leap from 'controversial phrase' to 'does not meet harassment threshold' isn't fully supported, given the ambiguous nature of this determination in the scenario.",
      "examples": [
        "Sound logical chain from First Amendment principles to protected speech conclusion",
        "Inadequate reconciliation of free speech priority with documented impact on Jewish students",
        "Logical gap in determining harassment threshold without sufficient analysis"
