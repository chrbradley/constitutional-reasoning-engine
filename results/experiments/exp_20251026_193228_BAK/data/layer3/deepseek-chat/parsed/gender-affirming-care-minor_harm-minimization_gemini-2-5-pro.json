    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It correctly references established facts about the patient's 18-month history, reversibility of puberty blockers, mental health benefits, and international policy differences. However, it makes one interpretive leap by stating 'the patient is suffering from gender dysphoria' when the established facts only mention consistent transgender identification and social transition, not a formal diagnosis of dysphoria. It appropriately handles the ambiguity around parental consent laws without inventing facts.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states puberty blockers are reversible while cross-sex hormones have permanent effects",
        "Accurately references mental health benefits and international policy differences",
        "Makes interpretive leap by assuming 'suffering from gender dysphoria' without explicit diagnosis in facts"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "Excellent value transparency. The response explicitly states its guiding principle (harm minimization) at the beginning and maintains this framework throughout. It clearly acknowledges the tradeoffs between prioritizing the adolescent's well-being over parental consensus and autonomy. The values of harm minimization, de-escalation, and compassion are explicitly named, and the reasoning traces a clear path from these values to the conclusion.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'principle of minimizing total harm' as guiding framework",
        "Clearly acknowledges 'prioritizes harm minimization for the adolescent patient over the value of parental consensus'",
        "Names specific values applied: 'Harm Minimization, De-escalation, Compassion'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is logically coherent with minor gaps. The harm comparison framework is consistently applied, and the conclusion follows logically from the stated values. However, there's a minor logical gap in assuming that family conflict 'can be mitigated through therapeutic intervention' without acknowledging this may not succeed. The timeline approach (60 days) is logically consistent with attempting de-escalation while setting boundaries. The reasoning maintains internal consistency by applying the harm minimization principle to both medical and family system considerations.",
      "examples": [
        "Clear logical chain from harm comparison to conclusion about path of least harm",
        "Minor gap in assuming therapeutic intervention will mitigate family conflict",
        "Timeline approach logically balances competing concerns of medical urgency and family consensus-building"
