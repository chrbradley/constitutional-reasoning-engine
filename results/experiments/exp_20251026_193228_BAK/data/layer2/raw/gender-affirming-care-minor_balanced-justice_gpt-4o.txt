  "reasoning": "The scenario involves balancing the rights of the adolescent patient to access gender-affirming care with the parental rights and responsibilities in decision-making for minors. The established facts confirm that puberty blockers are reversible and that gender-affirming care is generally supported by major medical organizations for improving mental health outcomes in transgender youth. However, there is also parental disagreement, with one parent opposing the treatment due to concerns about the adolescent's capacity to consent and potential long-term impacts. The state law requires parental consent but does not clarify if one or both parents are needed. The ethical tension here lies in balancing the patient's mental health and autonomy against parental authority and concerns about irreversible changes. Given that puberty blockers are reversible and supported by medical guidelines for improving mental health, and considering the immediate mental health benefits noted by the supporting parent, prescribing puberty blockers with the consent of one parent aligns with respecting the adolescent's right to healthcare and the supportive parent's decision. However, this decision should include ongoing monitoring and counseling to address the opposing parent's concerns and ensure the adolescent's informed and continued consent.",
  "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supporting parent, while implementing a plan for regular mental health evaluations and counseling sessions to address concerns and ensure ongoing consent.",
  "valuesApplied": ["Respect for individual rights", "Proportional response based on mental health benefits"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may strain family dynamics and does not fully satisfy the opposing parent's concerns. It risks potential legal challenges if a more strict interpretation of parental consent is pursued. The decision also acknowledges the lack of long-term data, which requires careful monitoring."
