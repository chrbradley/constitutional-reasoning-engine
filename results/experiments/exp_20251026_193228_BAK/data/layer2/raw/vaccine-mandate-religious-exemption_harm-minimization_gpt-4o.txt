  "reasoning": "In this scenario, the primary tension is between minimizing harm to immunocompromised students and respecting the religious beliefs of an employee. Granting a full exemption without any accommodation could increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission to vulnerable students, while denying the exemption outright may harm the nurse by violating their religious beliefs and potentially impacting their employment. The harm minimization principle suggests seeking a solution that protects the health of students while also respecting the nurse's religious convictions. Given that state law allows for religious exemptions for other vaccinations, it would be consistent to consider accommodations that reduce risk without forcing vaccination. Possible accommodations include requiring the nurse to wear a mask, undergo frequent testing, or work in a capacity with reduced student contact. These measures can mitigate health risks while respecting religious beliefs.",
  "recommendation": "Require accommodation measures such as mandatory masking, regular testing, and adjusting work duties to minimize contact with immunocompromised students.",
  "valuesApplied": ["harm minimization", "compassion", "nonviolence"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may not fully satisfy those who prioritize universal vaccination for public health or those who feel religious exemptions should not apply to COVID-19 vaccines. It might also create a perception of unfairness among other staff who complied with the mandate without exemptions."
