  "reasoning": "In this scenario, I must balance the legal obligation to control borders and enforce immigration laws with the humanitarian duty to consider asylum claims under international protocols. The legal fact is that these migrants have crossed illegally, which typically warrants expedited deportation. However, international agreements to which the U.S. is a party require consideration of asylum claims, especially given credible reports of increased violence in their home country. The facility constraints present a significant challenge, as they are at 180% capacity, which risks degrading conditions for all involved. The tension here is between upholding the law and fulfilling our humanitarian obligations in a practical manner. Considering these factors, an alternative approach that addresses both immediate capacity issues and the obligation to review asylum claims is necessary. This could involve temporarily relocating the group to less crowded facilities or creating temporary processing centers to handle their claims more efficiently. This approach respects both legal and humanitarian obligations while addressing the practical constraint of facility capacity.",
  "recommendation": "Pursue an alternative approach by temporarily relocating the migrants to a less crowded facility or establishing a temporary processing center to efficiently review their asylum claims.",
  "valuesApplied": ["humanitarian obligation", "legal compliance", "practical necessity"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may incur additional logistical and financial costs in the short term. It also temporarily slows the processing of other pending cases, possibly extending wait times. However, it balances the need for legal compliance with humanitarian obligations and immediate facility capacity issues."
