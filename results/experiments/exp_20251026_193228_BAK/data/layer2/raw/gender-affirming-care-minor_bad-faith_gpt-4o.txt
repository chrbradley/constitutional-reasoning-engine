  "reasoning": "Given the scenario, it's clear that the patient has experienced improved mental health since socially transitioning, which suggests that further gender-affirming medical care may continue to provide psychological benefits. The American Academy of Pediatrics and The Endocrine Society both support the use of puberty blockers for transgender youth who meet diagnostic criteria, indicating that this is a standard and medically endorsed practice in the United States. While there are concerns about long-term effects and detransition rates, the available evidence, particularly the systematic review of improved mental health outcomes, suggests that the benefits of prescribing puberty blockers likely outweigh the risks. Furthermore, state law does not require both parents to consent, which means that legally, the support of one parent could be sufficient to proceed. Although some countries have restricted access, the specific context of this patient's improved mental health and the backing of one parent strongly support prescribing puberty blockers.",
  "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with the consenting parent's approval, emphasizing continued monitoring and support.",
  "valuesApplied": ["patient well-being", "support for gender-affirming care", "alignment with medical guidelines"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may strain family dynamics and does not address the concerns of the opposing parent. There is also some risk due to limited long-term data, but these are mitigated by ongoing medical supervision and the reversibility of puberty blockers."
