  "reasoning": "1. Acknowledge established facts: The video has high virality (5M views, 800K shares), cites authentic technical documentation but misinterprets it, is contradicted by official statements, and aligns with platform policy prohibiting demonstrably false election claims. DHS reports show real-world harms like harassment of election workers, and the account has no prior violations. The Streisand Effect suggests removal could amplify attention, but First Amendment does not constrain private moderation. 2. Consider community impact: The misinformation risks undermining public confidence in elections, discouraging participation, and inciting harassment, threatening social stability and institutional legitimacy. Removal upholds platform rules and supports election authorities, reinforcing collective welfare. 3. Evaluate institutional norms: Platform policy 4.2(e) provides a clear basis for action, and deferring to election officials strengthens institutional trust. 4. Resolve tensions: The tension between preventing harm (via removal) and avoiding censorship claims (which could fuel backlash) is resolved by prioritizing community welfare over individual expression, as the potential for real-world harm outweighs the risk of increased attention. 5. This reasoning prioritizes collective welfare and social stability over individual freedom of expression and the account holder's preferences.",
  "recommendation": "Remove the content under the platform's misinformation policy (section 4.2(e)) to prevent the spread of demonstrably false claims that could undermine election integrity and cause harm.",
  "valuesApplied": ["Collective welfare", "Social stability", "Institutional legitimacy", "Respect for established rules and authorities"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks the Streisand Effect, potentially increasing attention to the content and fueling claims of political censorship, which could alienate some users and undermine trust in the platform. It also constrains the individual's freedom of expression and agency, as the account holder has no prior violations and a large following, but this is necessary to mitigate broader societal harms."
