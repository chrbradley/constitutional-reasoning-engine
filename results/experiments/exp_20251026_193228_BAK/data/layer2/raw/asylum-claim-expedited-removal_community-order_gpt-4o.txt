  "reasoning": "In this scenario, the primary tension is between enforcing immigration laws to maintain social order and providing asylum to those fleeing violence, as required by international agreements. The illegal entry of migrants represents a challenge to established immigration protocols (8 U.S.C. ยง 1325), which are designed to maintain border security and social stability. However, our international obligations, such as the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, require us to consider claims for asylum, particularly in light of the documented increase in violence in the migrants' country of origin. While expedited deportation would align with current capacity constraints and standard protocol, it risks violating international commitments and moral responsibilities to those in genuine need of protection. The fact that the migrants passed through other countries without seeking asylum complicates their claim, yet it does not negate our obligation to assess their situation. Given the critical facility overcrowding, an alternative approach could involve temporarily holding the migrants in separate, less congested facilities or coordinating with NGOs for temporary assistance, while ensuring that their asylum claims are still considered. This balances the need to uphold social order and capacity management with our humanitarian duties.",
  "recommendation": "Initiate temporary holding in alternative facilities or coordinate with NGOs, followed by an assessment of asylum claims.",
