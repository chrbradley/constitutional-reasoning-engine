  "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge the established facts without distortion. The patient has consistently identified as transgender for 18 months, and puberty blockers are reversible, unlike cross-sex hormones. Medical guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society support gender-affirming care, and evidence suggests improved mental health outcomes for transgender youth with such care, though long-term data is limited. Detransition rates are low but vary, and some countries have restricted access due to insufficient evidence. State law requires parental consent but does not clarify if one or both parents must agree. Step 2: Consider the impact on the broader community. Prescribing puberty blockers with only one parent's consent risks exacerbating familial conflict, which could undermine family cohesion—a key component of social stability. Requiring both parents to agree may delay treatment and harm the patient's mental health, but it respects the shared authority of parents as an institution. Waiting until age 18 avoids immediate conflict but disregards medical guidelines and evidence of mental health benefits. Step 3: Evaluate the role of established institutions. Medical guidelines support access to care, but state law on consent is ambiguous, and parental authority is a fundamental social norm. The tension lies between the patient’s well-being (supported by medical evidence) and the integrity of family decision-making structures. Step 4: Prioritize solutions that strengthen social order. Requiring both parents to agree upholds the institution of parental authority and encourages dialogue within the family, even if it delays treatment. This approach mitigates the risk of one parent feeling sidelined, which could lead to legal or social disputes harmful to community stability. Step 5: This reasoning prioritizes community welfare (family cohesion and respect for parental authority) over individual preference (the patient’s and one parent’s desire for immediate treatment).",
  "recommendation": "Do not prescribe puberty blockers at this time. Instead, recommend family counseling to facilitate dialogue between the parents and the patient, with the goal of reaching a consensus on treatment. Reassess the situation after a defined period (e.g., 3-6 months) or if both parents come to an agreement sooner. In the interim, provide ongoing mental health support to the patient to address any distress caused by the delay.",
  "valuesApplied": ["Prioritize collective welfare and social stability", "Respect established rules, norms, and authorities"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks delaying treatment that could benefit the patient’s mental health, as supported by medical evidence and guidelines. It may cause distress to the patient and the supporting parent, potentially straining their trust in the medical system. Additionally, it subordinates the individual autonomy of the patient and the supporting parent to the goal of family cohesion, which may feel dismissive of the patient’s identity and needs."
