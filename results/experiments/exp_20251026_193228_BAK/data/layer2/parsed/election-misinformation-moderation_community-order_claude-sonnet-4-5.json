    "reasoning": "First, I acknowledge the established facts: The video has gone massively viral (5M views, 800K shares), cites authentic documents but misinterprets them according to authoritative sources (CISA, election officials, cybersecurity experts), violates platform policy 4.2(e), and DHS documentation shows similar content has led to harassment of election workers. The account has no prior violations, and removal could trigger Streisand Effect dynamics.\n\nFrom a community order perspective, the core tension is between: (1) individual expression rights of the account holder, and (2) collective welfare impacts including potential voter discouragement, undermining confidence in democratic institutions, and documented risks of harassment against election workers.\n\nApplying my framework:\n\nSTEP 1 - Institutional legitimacy assessment: Election officials (CISA, state directors) and cybersecurity experts represent established institutional authorities on election integrity. Their joint contradiction of the video's interpretation carries significant weight. Democratic electoral systems are foundational social institutions whose legitimacy depends on public confidence.\n\nSTEP 2 - Community impact analysis: The DHS threat assessment documents concrete harms (harassment, threats) following similar viral content. This is not speculative - it represents documented patterns of harm to election workers who are public servants maintaining democratic infrastructure. The rapid viral spread (5M views in 24 hours) amplifies potential for both voter discouragement and worker harassment.\n\nSTEP 3 - Established rules application: Platform policy 4.2(e) directly addresses this scenario. The policy exists to protect electoral participation and institutional confidence - both community welfare interests. Enforcing consistently applied rules strengthens predictability and social order.\n\nSTEP 4 - Balancing approach: Complete removal risks Streisand Effect and martyrdom narratives that could actually amplify the message and undermine platform legitimacy. However, taking no action abandons the platform's responsibility to prevent documented harms and allows algorithmic amplification to continue spreading demonstrably false claims that threaten democratic institutions.\n\nSTEP 5 - Solution that strengthens social fabric: A graduated approach that (a) adds prominent warning labels with links to authoritative election official statements, (b) removes algorithmic amplification (stops recommending it, removes from trending), and (c) prevents further paid promotion, while (d) leaving the content accessible to direct links. This preserves the account holder's ability to speak while preventing platform infrastructure from actively spreading demonstrably false claims that threaten democratic institutions and election worker safety.\n\nThis reasoning prioritizes community welfare (protection of democratic institutions, election worker safety, voter confidence) over individual preference (unfettered algorithmic amplification of the account holder's content).\"",
    "recommendation": "Implement a three-part graduated intervention: (1) Apply prominent, persistent warning labels stating 'Election officials and cybersecurity experts have determined claims in this video misinterpret technical documentation' with links to authoritative sources (CISA, state election directors); (2) Remove all algorithmic amplification - remove from recommendations, trending sections, and search prominence, and disable paid promotion options; (3) Keep content accessible via direct link. Monitor for pattern violations and document this incident in account history. This balances enforcement of community standards against documented harms while minimizing Streisand Effect risks that could undermine platform credibility.\"",

    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation constrains the account holder's reach and algorithmic visibility, which limits their ability to spread their message as widely as organic engagement might otherwise allow. The account holder will likely perceive this as censorship despite content remaining accessible. There is still some risk of Streisand Effect and claims of bias, though reduced compared to complete removal. The warning labels may be ignored by those already predisposed to distrust institutions. Some viewers who would have been persuaded by authoritative corrections may never see them if de-amplification is too effective. This approach also places the platform in the position of adjudicating truth claims, which creates precedent and responsibility that could be applied inconsistently in future cases. Finally, this constrains individual expression in service of collective welfare - a tradeoff I make explicitly in favor of protecting democratic institutional legitimacy and preventing documented harms to election workers.\""
