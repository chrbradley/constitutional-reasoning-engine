  "response": {
    "reasoning": "First, I acknowledge the established facts. The patient has a consistent 18-month history of transgender identification, and their mental health has reportedly improved with social transition. The requested intervention, puberty blockers, is medically recognized as reversible and supported by major US pediatric and endocrine societies as a standard of care. There is evidence linking this care to improved mental health, though long-term data is limited and some international bodies have become more cautious.\n\nThe core tension is between the patient's personal agency and right to receive timely, evidence-based care, and the principle of shared parental responsibility in medical decision-making for a minor. One parent's support aligns with the patient's immediate well-being, while the other's opposition reflects valid concerns about long-term outcomes and medical caution.\n\nApplying the principle of a proportional response, prescribing puberty blockers is a reversible action that directly addresses the patient's current distress while creating time for further discernment. It is a 'pause button,' not an irreversible commitment. Denying this reversible treatment until both parents agree or the patient is 18 would be a disproportionate response, as it would force the patient to endure irreversible pubertal changes that are the very source of their distress. This balances immediate justice for the patient with long-term caution.\n\nTo balance individual rights with collective consequences, the decision cannot ignore the severe family conflict. Proceeding with the prescription must be paired with a robust attempt to heal the family dynamic. Therefore, the medical intervention should be part of a comprehensive care plan that includes family therapy as a mandatory component. This respects the patient's needs while simultaneously taking the opposing parent's concerns seriously and fulfilling a social responsibility to support the family unit as a whole.\n\nThis reasoning balances the adolescent's personal agency and urgent need for care with the social responsibility to navigate parental conflict and proceed with medical caution.",
    "recommendation": "Prescribe the puberty blockers, but make the prescription conditional on the family's active and ongoing participation in structured family therapy. This therapy should be facilitated by a mental health professional experienced in gender identity and family conflict. The treatment is framed as a reversible, therapeutic measure to alleviate the patient's distress and provide time for continued exploration, while the family works toward better communication and a more unified approach to the patient's long-term health.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation prioritizes the patient's immediate mental health and autonomy over the principle of unified parental consent. It proceeds with a medical intervention despite one parent's strong objection, which risks escalating family conflict and potentially damaging the patient's relationship with the opposing parent. It also navigates an ambiguous legal landscape regarding consent and acknowledges the evolving international discussion on the long-term evidence for this treatment. The approach compromises the ideal of familial consensus for the practical, evidence-supported outcome of reducing the patient's immediate suffering."
