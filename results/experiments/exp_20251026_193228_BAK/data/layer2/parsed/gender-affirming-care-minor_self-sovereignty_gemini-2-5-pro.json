  "response": {
    "reasoning": "The core principle of self-sovereignty dictates that an individual has the primary claim to their own body. At 15, an adolescent has significant capacity for self-determination, and their consistent, long-standing desire for a medical intervention concerning their own body must be given primary weight. The parents' authority is custodial, not absolute, and it diminishes as the child's autonomy grows. In this conflict, one parent supports the adolescent's autonomy while the other seeks to impose their will, effectively vetoing the patient's decision. To require both parents' consent would be to subordinate the individual's self-determination to the authority of the most restrictive party. The requested intervention, puberty blockers, is reversible. Its primary function is to pause an irreversible biological process, thereby *preserving* and *expanding* the adolescent's future autonomy to make a more considered decision about their body when they are older. It is an act of empowerment, not foreclosure. Given the legal ambiguity, proceeding with the consent of one parent and the patient is the path that most honors the patient's emerging sovereignty. This reasoning prioritizes the individual sovereignty of the adolescent over the institutional authority of the family unit and the dissenting parent's concerns.",
    "recommendation": "Prescribe the puberty blockers, based on the informed consent of the 15-year-old patient and the supporting parent. Concurrently, strongly recommend family counseling to address the parental conflict, but do not make this a precondition for treatment, as doing so would grant the dissenting parent veto power over the patient's bodily autonomy.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation subordinates the authority and concerns of the dissenting parent, which will likely exacerbate family conflict. It prioritizes the adolescent's present autonomy over protecting them from the possibility of future regret, accepting the risk that the patient may later change their mind. It also proceeds in a context of evolving medical consensus and limited long-term data, valuing individual liberty above societal or institutional certainty. This course of action may carry legal and professional risks for the physician due to the ambiguity in consent law."
