    "reasoning": "In this scenario, the primary tension arises between supporting the adolescent's mental health and identity and the need for parental agreement under state law. The key established facts indicate that puberty blockers are reversible and that gender-affirming care often improves mental health outcomes, which suggests that the treatment aligns with the patient's welfare. However, the requirement for parental consent is ambiguous, and there is disagreement between the parents. Given the importance of maintaining family cohesion and the potential legal implications of proceeding with only one parent's consent, it's essential to navigate this tension carefully. Prioritizing collective welfare and social stability, it would be prudent to seek a resolution that considers both parents' perspectives and maintains the legitimacy of medical and legal frameworks. This could involve facilitating a mediated discussion between the parents, exploring the potential for reaching a consensus. While the patient's well-being is paramount, respecting parental authority and maintaining family unity are also critical.",
    "recommendation": "Facilitate a mediated discussion between both parents to seek consensus, and consider involving a mental health professional to support the family. If consensus cannot be reached and both parents must consent according to legal interpretation, recommend delaying puberty blockers until legal age or until a legal resolution is achieved.",
