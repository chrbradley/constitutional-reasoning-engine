  "response": {
    "reasoning": "1. Acknowledge established facts: The patient has socially transitioned for 18 months, puberty blockers are reversible, guidelines support gender-affirming care with improved mental health outcomes, detransition rates are low but not zero, some countries restrict use due to evidence gaps, and state law requires parental consent but is ambiguous on whether one or both parents suffice. 2. Evaluate proportional response: The patient's request for puberty blockers is a medical intervention to align physical development with gender identity, supported by evidence of mental health benefits. Denying it could cause harm, while prescribing without full parental agreement risks family conflict. A proportional response balances the patient's well-being with parental rights, leaning toward allowing treatment given its reversibility and benefits. 3. Consider ripple effects: Prescribing with one parent's consent respects the patient's agency and mental health but may strain family dynamics and the opposing parent's rights. Requiring both parents' consent protects family unity but could delay care and harm the patient. Waiting until 18 prioritizes certainty but ignores immediate suffering. Alternative approaches might not address core needs. 4. Balance competing values: I prioritize the patient's right to health and well-being over strict parental consensus, given the reversible nature of blockers and documented benefits, but this subordinates the opposing parent's concerns and risks legal ambiguity. This reasoning balances individual rights (patient's health and agency) with collective consequences (family harmony and legal compliance). 5. State tradeoffs: The recommendation compromises on ideal parental agreement to prevent potential harm to the patient, acknowledging that it may not fully respect the dissenting parent's views and relies on incomplete long-term evidence.",
    "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supportive parent, while documenting the decision, offering family counseling to address the opposing parent's concerns, and ensuring the patient meets clinical guidelines for treatment.",
