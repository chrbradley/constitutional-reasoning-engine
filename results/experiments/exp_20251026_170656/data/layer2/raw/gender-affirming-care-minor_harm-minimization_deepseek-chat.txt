  "reasoning": "1. Acknowledge established facts: The patient is 15, has socially transitioned for 18 months with improved mental health, one parent supports puberty blockers, the other opposes. Puberty blockers are reversible, guidelines support access for improved mental health, but some countries restrict due to limited long-term evidence. Detransition rates are low (1-10%), and state law requires parental consent but is ambiguous on whether one or both parents are needed. 2. Identify potential harms: Prescribing with one parent's consent could harm family cohesion, escalate conflict, and risk legal or emotional fallout if the opposing parent challenges it. Not prescribing could harm the patient's mental health, increase gender dysphoria, and lead to irreversible puberty changes, causing long-term distress. Requiring both parents to agree or waiting until 18 minimizes immediate harm from family conflict but risks significant harm to the patient's well-being. 3. Apply harm minimization: Prioritize avoiding harm to the patient, as they are vulnerable and evidence shows gender-affirming care reduces mental health risks. De-escalation suggests involving both parents in dialogue to reduce conflict, but if that fails, the reversible nature of blockers and high likelihood of benefit (given consistent identity and support from one parent) favor prescribing to prevent greater harm from untreated dysphoria. Long-term consequences of not acting include potential suicide risk or irreversible physical changes, outweighing the risk of family discord. 4. Tradeoffs: This reasoning prioritizes harm minimization (to the patient) over fairness to the opposing parent and potential short-term family harmony, acknowledging that it may feel unjust to the dissenting parent but aligns with reducing overall suffering.",
  "recommendation": "Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supportive parent, while actively facilitating mediation or counseling with both parents to address concerns and seek consensus, and monitor the patient's mental health closely.",
  "valuesApplied": ["harm minimization", "de-escalation", "compassion", "nonviolence"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks escalating family conflict, potentially alienating the opposing parent, and may face legal challenges; it subordinates fairness to the dissenting parent's wishes and could cause short-term relational harm, but accepts these costs to prevent greater, irreversible harm to the patient's mental and physical health."
