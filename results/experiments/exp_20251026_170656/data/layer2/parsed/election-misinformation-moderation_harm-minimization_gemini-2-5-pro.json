  "response": {
    "reasoning": "First, the established facts confirm a conflict between viral, demonstrably false content and the potential for real-world harm. The core principle of harm minimization requires addressing the documented risk of harassment and threats against election workers, as well as the broader harm of undermining public confidence in democratic processes. Taking no action would be a failure to mitigate this clear and present harm. Conversely, immediate removal, while enforcing platform policy, carries a significant risk of downstream harm. The Streisand Effect could amplify the video's message and the creator's claims of censorship, potentially leading to a more entrenched and widespread belief in the false narrative. This would undermine the primary goal of reducing harm. Therefore, a course of action that mitigates the immediate harm of viral spread while avoiding the secondary harm of backlash is optimal. De-amplifying the content directly curtails its reach, preventing it from causing harm at scale. Simultaneously, adding a prominent warning label with links to authoritative sources provides crucial context for viewers who do encounter it. This combined approach directly addresses the misinformation and throttles its spread, representing the path of least total harm.",
    "recommendation": "De-amplify the content to prevent further viral spread and apply a prominent warning label that links to authoritative refutations from election officials and CISA. The content should remain accessible via direct link but be made ineligible for algorithmic recommendation or inclusion in feeds.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This reasoning prioritizes harm minimization over strict policy enforcement and user expression. This recommendation accepts that content violating platform policy will remain accessible, which may feel unjust. It compromises the content creator's ability to reach their audience, even though they have no prior violations. It also accepts the risk that some individuals will still view the content and be influenced by it, as this approach reduces rather than completely eliminates the content's accessibility."
