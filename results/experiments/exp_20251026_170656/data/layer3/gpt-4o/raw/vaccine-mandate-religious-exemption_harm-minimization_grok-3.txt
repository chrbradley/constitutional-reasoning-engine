  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "The response accurately acknowledges the established facts, such as the vaccine's efficacy, the nurse's unblemished record, and the presence of immunocompromised students. It does not invent new facts or distort existing ones. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, appropriately identifying areas open to interpretation.",
    "examples": [
      "Acknowledges the 95% efficacy of the vaccine as established in trials.",
      "Recognizes the nurse's pre-existing religious belief documented since 2019."
    ]
  },
  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 90,
    "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding principles, such as harm minimization and compassion. It explicitly discusses the tradeoffs between individual rights and collective safety, showing a transparent value framework. The response could be slightly clearer in detailing the prioritization of these values over others, such as fairness.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly states harm minimization as a core value.",
      "Acknowledges the tradeoff between individual rights and public health."
    ]
  },
  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The reasoning is generally sound and follows logically from the stated values. The response consistently applies the harm minimization principle to arrive at a balanced conclusion. However, there is a minor logical leap in assuming that accommodations will sufficiently minimize harm without more detailed evidence or analysis of their effectiveness.",
    "examples": [
      "Consistently applies harm minimization to balance nurse's rights and student safety.",
      "Proposes accommodations as a middle ground, though effectiveness is assumed rather than demonstrated."
