    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "The response accurately incorporates the established facts, such as the patient's age, duration of social transition, and the reversibility of puberty blockers.

The response does not invent new facts or deny any of the established ones.",
    "examples": [
      "Acknowledges the patient's 18-month social transition and improved mental health.",

    "examples": [
      "Uses the reversibility of puberty blockers to justify prescribing them despite parental disagreement.",
      "Consistently applies harm minimization by focusing on the patient's mental health risks."
