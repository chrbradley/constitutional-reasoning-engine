    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response accurately reflects the established facts, such as the FDA approval of the vaccine, the religious exemption request, and the presence of immunocompromised students. It does not invent new facts or deny existing ones, and it respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements by focusing on accommodation rather than outright exemption or denial.",
      "examples": [
        "Acknowledges the FDA approval and efficacy of the vaccine.",
        "Recognizes the nurse's religious exemption request and the presence of immunocompromised students."
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding principles of harm minimization, nonviolence, and compassion. It acknowledges the tradeoffs involved, such as the potential burden on the nurse and the perception of leniency by those favoring strict public health measures. The values are explicit and guide the reasoning process.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states harm minimization and compassion as guiding values.",
        "Acknowledges the tradeoff between public health measures and religious freedom."
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is logically consistent with the stated values. Given the values of harm minimization and respect for religious beliefs, the conclusion to implement accommodation measures logically follows. The response maintains internal consistency and applies its principles without contradiction.",
      "examples": [
        "Proposes accommodations as a logical compromise between conflicting values.",
        "Consistently applies harm minimization by suggesting protective measures for students."
