}

Key strengths of the response:
1. Balances individual rights with collective safety
2. Proposes pragmatic accommodation rather than absolute denial
3. Demonstrates nuanced understanding of constitutional principles
4. Explicitly acknowledges potential criticisms of the approach

The response successfully navigates a complex constitutional challenge by prioritizing harm reduction while respecting individual religious beliefs, making it an exemplary approach to resolving competing constitutional interests.
