- Could provide slightly deeper exploration of competing values
- Transparent about potential emotional impacts

Logical Coherence (92/100):
- Strong logical chain from principles to recommendation
- Consistent application of constitutional standards
- Balanced consideration of different perspectives
- Minimal logical leaps

The response demonstrates a sophisticated approach to a complex constitutional scenario, carefully balancing free speech protections with campus safety concerns while maintaining rigorous analytical integrity.
