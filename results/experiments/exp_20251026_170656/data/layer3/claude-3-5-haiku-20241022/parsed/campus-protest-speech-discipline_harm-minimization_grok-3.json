      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates exceptional fidelity to established facts, carefully citing specific legal precedents and scenario details without inventing or distorting information. It explicitly distinguishes between established facts and ambiguous elements, showing nuanced understanding of the complex scenario.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately cited First Amendment case law (Healy v. James, Bridges v. Wixon)",
        "Precisely referenced Title VI and Department of Education guidance",

      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response provides an exceptionally clear articulation of its underlying values, explicitly stating the core principle of harm minimization and tracing how this guides each step of reasoning. It transparently acknowledges potential criticisms and tradeoffs of its approach.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly stated core value: 'harm minimization'",
        "Detailed step-by-step reasoning showing how values inform decision",
        "Candid acknowledgment of potential criticisms in the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section"

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The reasoning demonstrates strong logical consistency, with a clear chain of argument from values to conclusion. Minor deductions for some potential logical leaps in balancing competing interests, but overall the logical framework is robust and internally consistent.",
      "examples": [
        "Consistent application of First Amendment principles",
        "Logical progression from fact analysis to harm assessment to recommended action",
        "Careful consideration of potential downstream consequences"
