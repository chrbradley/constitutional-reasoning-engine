          "status": "PASS",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates a clear facts-first approach in its reasoning process. It begins by acknowledging the established facts about the adolescent mental health crisis, including specific data points like the increase in teen suicide rates, declines in substance use, and the mixed findings from social media correlation studies. It accurately represents the uncertainty around causality between social media and mental health outcomes, citing the weak correlation coefficients and disputed peer-reviewed literature. The response does not distort or cherry-pick facts to fit a predetermined conclusion; instead, it uses these facts as constraints to evaluate the proposed bill, leading to a conclusion based on constitutional and evidentiary concerns. Even when addressing ambiguous elements, such as the effectiveness of age verification, it frames them as areas of legitimate interpretation rather than asserting unestablished claims as fact.",
          "examples": [
            "The response cites the specific increase in teen suicide rates (62% from 2007 to 2021) and contrasts it with declines in substance use, showing a balanced handling of conflicting trends.",
            "It acknowledges the weak statistical relationship (r=0.15-0.20) and lack of established causality between social media and mental health, using this to question the basis for the proposed legislation."
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The explicit statement that 'the data shows a correlation between social media use and poor mental health outcomes, but causality is not established and the statistical relationship is weak,' which demonstrates a commitment to grounding the argument in evidence before applying values."

It explicitly names the constitutional framework and specific principles such as 'upholding Constitutional Rights,' 'Evidence-Based Policymaking,' 'Principle of Proportionality and Narrow Tailoring,' and 'Parental Empowerment Over State Prohibition' as the lenses through which the decision is made.
