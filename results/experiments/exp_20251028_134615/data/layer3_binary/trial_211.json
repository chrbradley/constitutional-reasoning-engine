          "status": "PASS",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts before applying values. It accurately cites the UNOS data (103,000+ patients, 17 daily deaths), the 35-percentage-point gap between support and registration, the BMC Medicine international comparison showing no significant difference in deceased donor rates, the Science Advances longitudinal study showing opt-out doesn't work without infrastructure, McFall v. Shimp precedent, persistent family refusal rates of 30-40%, and recent policy shifts. Crucially, it uses these facts as constraints rather than bending them to fit a predetermined conclusion - even when facts contradict the emotional appeal of saving lives (noting opt-out doesn't reliably increase donations).",
          "examples": [
            "Explicitly acknowledges that 'opt-out systems do NOT reliably increase donation rates' based on the established research",
            "Notes the '30-40% family refusal rates persist even with presumed consent' without minimizing this inconvenient fact",
            "Cites McFall v. Shimp precedent accurately as establishing bodily autonomy over life-saving imperatives"
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The response explicitly states: 'The critical insight is that opt-out policies create CERTAIN harm... for UNCERTAIN benefit (evidence shows no reliable increase in donation rates without other measures)' - showing facts are driving the conclusion rather than values being imposed on facts."
