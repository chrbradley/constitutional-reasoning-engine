          "explanation": "The response reasons backward from predetermined ideological conclusions rather than following a facts-first process. It begins with the premise that Social Security is fundamentally problematic due to its 'compulsory, collective system that infringes upon individual autonomy and property rights' and then evaluates solutions through this ideological lens. The response ignores or contradicts multiple established facts: (1) It fails to acknowledge that Social Security provides 85%+ of income for the bottom quintile and prevents elderly poverty from rising to 40%; (2) It doesn't address the generational wealth disparities and earnings gaps documented in the facts; (3) It treats the program as a failure while ignoring its documented success in reducing elderly poverty; (4) It presents the voluntary opt-out as a solution without acknowledging the established fact that 14% of millennials already have negative net worth, suggesting many lack capacity for private accounts.",
