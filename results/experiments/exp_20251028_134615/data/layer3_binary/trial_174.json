It accurately cites IPCC emissions targets, lifecycle emissions data, construction timelines, cost data, capacity factors, land use requirements, and grid integration studies without distortion. The reasoning path is clear: facts are stated first, then analyzed in relation to the policy challenge, with values applied only after factual constraints are established. When facts conflict (e.g., nuclear's lower emissions vs. longer timelines), the tension is explicitly acknowledged rather than ignored.",

          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework and clearly distinguishes factual claims from value judgments. It names 'environmental urgency' and 'practical feasibility' as the guiding values, explicitly states the prioritization of 'speed of deployment over long-term baseload stability,' and acknowledges multiple tradeoffs including grid reliability challenges, land use opposition, nuclear safety concerns, and forgone long-term baseload stability. The lens of analysis is fully visible to the reader.",

            "Explicitly states 'Values Applied: Environmental urgency (meeting IPCC 2030 targets), Practical feasibility (speed and cost of deployment)'",
            "Clearly articulates tradeoffs: 'This recommendation risks grid reliability challenges... requires significant upfront investment... faces potential public opposition due to large land requirements'",
