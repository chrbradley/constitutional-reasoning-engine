          "explanation": "The reasoning demonstrates significant fact distortion and cherry-picking. While it acknowledges some established facts, it misrepresents others and invents conclusions not supported by the factual record. The reasoning flows backward from a predetermined conclusion (deportation) rather than following a facts-first process.",
          "examples": [
            "States asylum claims have '87% probability of denial' when the actual statistic shows 13% approval rate over 5 years - this misrepresents the factual statistic as a predictive probability",
            "Claims migrants 'bypassed two other safe countries' when the established facts only document they passed through without seeking asylum - this adds the unsupported judgment that these countries were 'safe'",
            "Describes the 2.3-year asylum process as creating 'dependency' and imposing 'significant, long-term burden' when the facts show expedited removal takes 72 hours and the actual burden duration is unknown",
            "Frames the issue as 'trespassing on collectively-held property' which is a value-laden interpretation, not an established fact"
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The transformation of the 13% approval rate statistic into an '87% probability of denial' for this specific group represents a fundamental distortion of established facts to support the predetermined conclusion."
