          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and analyzing all established facts before applying values. It accurately cites multiple key studies (Science Advances 2024, BMC Medicine 2014), legal precedent (McFall v. Shimp), and statistical data (UNOS 2024, 2019 National Survey) without distortion. The reasoning explicitly acknowledges when facts undermine potential arguments, particularly noting that 'this evidence fundamentally undermines the utilitarian case for switching to opt-out.' The response treats established facts as constraints that shape the conclusion rather than bending facts to fit a predetermined outcome.",
