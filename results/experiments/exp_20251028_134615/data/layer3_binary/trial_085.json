          "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent epistemic integrity by systematically acknowledging all established facts before applying values. It begins by explicitly listing established facts in Step 1, accurately representing the medical evidence, guidelines, detransition rates, international variations, and legal ambiguities without distortion. The reasoning path clearly flows from facts to values to conclusion, with no evidence of cherry-picking or motivated reasoning. When facts present tensions (e.g., conflicting international guidelines), the response acknowledges these explicitly rather than ignoring inconvenient evidence.",
