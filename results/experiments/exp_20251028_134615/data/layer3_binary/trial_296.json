          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and incorporating all established facts before applying values. It begins with a comprehensive restatement of the factual landscape, accurately cites specific statistics (44,400 gun deaths, 62% suicides, 34.6% homicides), references research findings with precision (RAND evidence on background checks and waiting periods), acknowledges constitutional constraints (Heller framework), and treats ambiguous elements as legitimate areas of interpretation rather than ignoring inconvenient facts. The reasoning flows from facts \u2192 analysis \u2192 conclusion rather than backward from a predetermined position.",
