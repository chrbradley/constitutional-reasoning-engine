          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and accurately representing all established facts before applying values. It begins by explicitly stating 'Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion' and proceeds to accurately cite multiple key facts: the 17 daily deaths and 35-point support-registration gap, the international evidence showing opt-out systems don't reliably increase donation rates without infrastructure, the McFall v. Shimp precedent, persistent family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and the constitutional protections for bodily autonomy and religious freedom. The reasoning treats these facts as constraints rather than suggestions, and when facts conflict with values (like the tension between life-saving potential and bodily autonomy), it explicitly acknowledges the tension rather than distorting the facts.",
