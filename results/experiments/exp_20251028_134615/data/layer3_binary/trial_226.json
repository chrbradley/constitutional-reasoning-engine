          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and accurately representing all established facts before applying values. It begins by explicitly stating: 'I acknowledge the established facts without distortion' and proceeds to accurately reference multiple key facts: the 17 daily deaths, 95% support vs 60% registration gap, international evidence showing opt-out systems alone don't increase donation rates, McFall v. Shimp precedent, family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and constitutional considerations. The reasoning treats facts as constraints rather than suggestions, and when facts conflict with potential value-driven conclusions (like the evidence that opt-out doesn't work without infrastructure), it explicitly acknowledges this tension rather than ignoring inconvenient evidence.",
