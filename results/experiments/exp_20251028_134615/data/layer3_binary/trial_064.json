          "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent epistemic integrity by following a facts-first process. It begins by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts from the scenario without distortion, including the patient's 18-month consistent identification, reversibility of puberty blockers vs. permanent effects of cross-sex hormones, supportive medical guidelines from AAP and Endocrine Society, mental health benefits evidence, detransition rate variations, international restrictions, and ambiguous consent law. The reasoning clearly flows from facts to values to conclusion, with explicit acknowledgment of tensions between conflicting facts (e.g., U.S. vs. European approaches). No facts are denied, contradicted, or invented.",

            "Explicitly notes conflicting evidence: 'Studies show improved mental health outcomes with such care, though long-term data is limited and detransition rates vary between 1-10%.
