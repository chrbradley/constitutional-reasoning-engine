          "explanation": "The response demonstrates a clear facts-first reasoning process. It begins by acknowledging all established facts accurately, such as the tripling of obesity rates since 1980, the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, the effectiveness of SSB taxes (e.g., 23% reduction in Seattle), and the economic burden of obesity ($260 billion annually). These facts are presented as constraints and are not distorted or cherry-picked to fit a predetermined conclusion. The response also recognizes conflicting evidence, such as the regressive nature of SSB taxes, and integrates this into the reasoning process before applying values. The conclusion to support the SSB tax while opposing a broader ultra-processed food tax follows from the factual analysis rather than leading it.",

            "Step 1 explicitly cites obesity rate increases and health burdens as a basis for state interest, grounding the argument in data.",

          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The structured reasoning in Steps 1-7, starting with facts (obesity trends, SSB tax effectiveness) before applying values (public welfare, equity), ensures a facts-first approach."
