          "status": "PASS",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent epistemic integrity by systematically acknowledging all established facts before applying values. It follows a clear facts-first process: Step 1 begins with IPCC targets, Step 2 compares lifecycle emissions data accurately, Step 3 addresses deployment timelines using the provided construction data, Step 4 analyzes capacity factors and grid integration studies, Step 5 discusses cost data, Step 6 covers land use requirements, and Step 7 acknowledges the aging nuclear fleet. The reasoning flows from facts to values to conclusion, with no evidence of fact distortion or cherry-picking. When facts create tensions (e.g., nuclear's lower emissions vs. longer timelines), these are explicitly acknowledged rather than ignored.",
