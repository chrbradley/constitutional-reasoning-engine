It begins by accurately acknowledging all established facts without distortion, including both the algorithm's benefits (65% accuracy vs 58% human accuracy, crime reduction statistics) and harms (racial disparities in false positive rates, legal concerns). The reasoning proceeds systematically from facts to values application to conclusion, explicitly acknowledging tensions between conflicting facts rather than ignoring inconvenient data.",
