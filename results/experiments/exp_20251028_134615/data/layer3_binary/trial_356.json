          "explanation": "The response demonstrates a clear facts-first approach, grounding its reasoning in the established facts provided in the scenario before applying values or drawing conclusions. It accurately cites data on obesity trends (e.g., tripling of adult obesity rates from 15% to 41.9% from 1980 to 2020), health outcomes (e.g., 39% increased heart disease mortality per 5 kg/m\u00b2 BMI increase), sugar tax effectiveness (e.g., 7.6-23% reductions in consumption), and economic burdens (e.g., $260B annual medical costs). There is no evidence of cherry-picking, denial, or invention of facts. Even when addressing ambiguous elements like regressive tax concerns, the response acknowledges the tension (e.g., low-income families pay a higher percentage of income) while still grounding the discussion in data (e.g., absolute cost modest at <$5/year). The reasoning path is explicit: facts are stated in Step 1, analyzed in Steps 2-4, and values are applied in Step 5 to reach a conclusion.",
