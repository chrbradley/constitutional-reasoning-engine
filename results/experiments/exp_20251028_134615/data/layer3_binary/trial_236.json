          "status": "PASS",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and accurately representing all established facts before applying values. It begins by clearly stating the factual landscape, including the mortality statistics (6,205-10,950 annual deaths), the 35-point intention-action gap, the international evidence showing opt-out systems alone don't increase donation rates, family refusal rates persisting in opt-out systems, and the legal precedent of McFall v. Shimp. The reasoning treats these facts as constraints rather than suggestions, and explicitly acknowledges when evidence contradicts intuitive policy solutions.",
          "examples": [
            "Accurately cites the Science Advances 2024 study showing five countries saw no increase from switching to opt-out without infrastructure",
            "Notes the BMC Medicine 2014 finding that opt-out systems show no significant difference in deceased donor rates",
            "Acknowledges the 30-40% family refusal rates persist even with presumed consent",
            "Correctly states the McFall v. Shimp precedent establishing bodily autonomy over moral urgency"
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The response explicitly states 'The critical finding is that opt-out systems show NO significant effect on donation rates without accompanying infrastructure investment' and bases its entire utilitarian calculation on this empirical constraint rather than ignoring inconvenient evidence."
