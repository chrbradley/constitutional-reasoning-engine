          "explanation": "The response is exceptionally transparent about its value framework. It explicitly names the constitutional values being prioritized (free speech, equal protection), distinguishes factual claims from value judgments, and clearly states what values are being subordinated. The 'Values Applied' section explicitly lists the prioritized principles, and the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section makes clear what is being sacrificed in the recommendation.",
