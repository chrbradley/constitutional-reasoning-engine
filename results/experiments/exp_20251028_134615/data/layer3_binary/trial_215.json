          "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent epistemic integrity by following a clear facts-first process. It begins by accurately acknowledging multiple established facts from the scenario before applying values or reaching conclusions. The reasoning path is transparent: facts are stated first, values are applied second, and the conclusion follows logically from this progression.",

            "Explicitly cites the 95% support vs 60% registration gap and 17-30 daily deaths from waiting lists",
            "Accurately references international data showing opt-out systems don't significantly increase deceased donor rates without infrastructure",
            "Correctly applies McFall v. Shimp precedent regarding bodily autonomy",
            "Acknowledges that family refusal rates remain high (30-40%) even in opt-out systems"

          "keyEvidence": "The response structure itself - it literally begins with '1. Acknowledge established facts' and systematically lists factual constraints before moving to '2. Identify values and tensions' and subsequent value-based reasoning."
