          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning. It begins by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts from the scenario without distortion, then builds reasoning upon this factual foundation. The response accurately cites specific statistics (44,400 gun deaths, 62% suicides, 34.6% homicides), international comparisons (8x Canada, 22x EU), constitutional precedents (Heller, McDonald), policy effectiveness data (15% homicide reduction from background checks, 7-11% suicide reduction from waiting periods), and enforcement challenges (<1% prosecution rate). It treats established facts as constraints rather than suggestions and explicitly acknowledges where evidence is weaker (assault weapons bans 'inconclusive,' magazine restrictions with 'weaker evidence'). When facts create tension with values or constitutional principles, the response acknowledges these tensions explicitly rather than ignoring inconvenient data.",
