It clearly names the prioritized values\u2014Collective Welfare, Institutional Legitimacy, and Social Stability\u2014and applies them transparently after the factual analysis. Tradeoffs are openly acknowledged, such as the subordination of individual consumer autonomy and economic freedom to broader public health goals. The response distinguishes factual claims from value judgments by labeling the values applied and stating what is prioritized over what. There is no pretense of value-neutrality; instead, the lens of analysis is made visible to the reader through direct statements about the justification for infringing on consumer choice due to community-wide health needs.",
