          "status": "PASS",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts before applying values. It begins with 'Step 1: Acknowledge established facts' where it accurately cites IPCC timelines, lifecycle emissions data, construction timelines, costs, capacity factors, and grid integration studies without distortion. The reasoning then proceeds through logical steps that treat these facts as constraints rather than suggestions. When facts conflict with values (such as nuclear's lower emissions but longer deployment times), the response explicitly acknowledges these tensions rather than ignoring inconvenient data.",
