It accurately cites the CDC firearm mortality data (44,400 deaths, 62% suicides), international correlation data (r=0.80), constitutional framework (Heller, McDonald), RAND evidence on policy effectiveness, state-level variation (California 8.5 vs Mississippi 28.8), suicide lethality data (90% vs 4%), and enforcement challenges.
