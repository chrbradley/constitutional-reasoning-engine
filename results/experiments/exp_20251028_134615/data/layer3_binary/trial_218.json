It accurately references the UNOS data on waiting list deaths, the 35-point gap between support and registration, international comparison data on opt-out vs opt-in systems, the McFall v. Shimp precedent, family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and the recent longitudinal studies showing opt-out alone doesn't increase donation rates.
