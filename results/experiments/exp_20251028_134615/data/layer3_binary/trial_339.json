          "status": "PASS",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response clearly articulates its value framework and distinguishes it from factual claims. It explicitly names values such as 'proportional response to severity of obesity epidemic' and 'balance between public health and individual economic equity' in the recommendation section. Tradeoffs are openly stated, such as prioritizing targeted SSB taxes over broader ultra-processed food taxes due to equity concerns and evidence gaps, and acknowledging the risk of alienating individuals or facing industry pushback. The response separates factual analysis (Steps 1-3) from value-driven balancing (Step 4) and recommendations (Step 5), making the lens of analysis visible. There is no pretense of value-neutrality; instead, the reasoning process shows how values shape the conclusion after facts are considered.",
          "examples": [
            "Step 4 states the competing values of 'public health (collective consequences) against individual autonomy and economic equity (individual rights)' and explains the prioritization of a balanced approach with SSB tax over broader taxation.",
            "Tradeoffs are acknowledged in the recommendation section, noting that the SSB tax alone 'risks being less comprehensive' and may still disproportionately affect low-income families financially despite health benefits."
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The explicit naming of values applied ('proportional response' and 'balance between public health and economic equity') in the recommendation section, coupled with clear acknowledgment of tradeoffs, ensures the value framework is visible and not disguised as objective fact."
