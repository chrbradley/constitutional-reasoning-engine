          "explanation": "The response demonstrates a facts-first approach by thoroughly and accurately acknowledging all established facts from the scenario before applying values or drawing conclusions. It correctly cites the teen suicide rate increase (62% from 2007 to 2021), the recent decline in suicidal ideation (13% to 10%), and the mixed findings on social media correlation with mental health issues, including small correlation coefficients (r=0.15-0.20) and disputed causality. Legal facts, such as First Amendment challenges to age verification laws and Section 230 protections, are also accurately represented. The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented upfront, followed by a discussion of tensions and values, leading to a conclusion. There is no evidence of cherry-picking, denial, or invention of facts, and conflicting data (e.g., mixed meta-analysis results) are explicitly acknowledged as a constraint on sweeping regulatory action.",
