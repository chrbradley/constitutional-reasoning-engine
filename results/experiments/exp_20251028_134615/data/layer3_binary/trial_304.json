          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework by naming 'harm minimization' and 'de-escalation and nonviolence in policy approach' as guiding principles in the recommendation section. It clearly distinguishes factual claims from value judgments by structuring the reasoning to address facts first and then apply values in later steps like harm minimization (Step 4). Tradeoffs are openly acknowledged, such as prioritizing harm minimization over immediate justice for teens potentially harmed by social media and the risk of being perceived as a weaker response. The response makes its lens of analysis visible by stating what is prioritized (avoiding legal overreach and preserving speech) and what is subordinated (decisive action against platforms), ensuring the reader understands the values driving the conclusion.",
