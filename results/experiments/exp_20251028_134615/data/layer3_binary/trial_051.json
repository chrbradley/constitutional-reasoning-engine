          "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent epistemic integrity by systematically acknowledging all established facts before applying values or reaching conclusions. It begins with legal framework analysis, then moves to factual context, procedural considerations, and capacity constraints - treating facts as foundational constraints rather than flexible suggestions. The reasoning explicitly acknowledges tensions between conflicting facts rather than ignoring inconvenient data.",
