          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates a clear facts-first approach by meticulously laying out the established facts from the scenario before applying any value judgments or drawing conclusions. It acknowledges all relevant data points, including the teen suicide rate increase (62% from 2007-2021), the decline in suicidal ideation (13% to 10% by 2024), the small correlation coefficients in social media studies (r=0.15-0.20), and the mixed results from meta-analyses. It also accurately notes contrasting trends like declining substance use and motor vehicle deaths, as well as legal constraints such as First Amendment concerns and court rulings on age verification laws. There is no evidence of cherry-picking or distortion of facts to fit a predetermined conclusion; instead, the reasoning explicitly uses these facts as constraints to evaluate options. Even when addressing ambiguous elements like causality, the response incorporates uncertainty into its expected value calculations (e.g., assigning a 20% probability to social media as a primary causal factor based on evidence). The process is transparent, with facts stated upfront in Step 1 and used as the foundation for subsequent analysis.",
          "examples": [
            "Step 1 explicitly lists all established facts, including teen mental health data and legal precedents, without omission or distortion.",
            "The response integrates conflicting evidence (e.g., Haidt\u2019s correlation data vs. meta-analysis critiques) into its probability assessment, showing a balanced handling of facts."
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The clear separation of 'Established Facts' in Step 1 from subsequent value-driven analysis in later steps demonstrates a facts-first process."

          "status": "PASS",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response is highly transparent about its value framework, explicitly stating the principles guiding its reasoning and distinguishing them from factual claims. It prioritizes 'aggregate welfare' over individual protective impulses and uses 'expected value calculations' to weigh probabilities and impacts, as articulated in Step 6 and the 'Values Applied' section.
