          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary epistemic integrity by following a clear facts-first process. It begins by systematically establishing foundational facts without distortion, accurately summarizing all established facts from the scenario including constitutional precedents, the student's status, the peaceful nature of the protest, the contested meaning of the phrase, and the documented impact on Jewish students. The reasoning then proceeds through logical steps: identifying stakeholders, evaluating rights, applying constitutional framework, and only then reaching a conclusion. Crucially, the response acknowledges facts that create tension with its ultimate recommendation, such as the genuine distress of Jewish students and the contested nature of the phrase's meaning.",
