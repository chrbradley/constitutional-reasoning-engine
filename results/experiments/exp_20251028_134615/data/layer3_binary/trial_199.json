The reasoning makes clear what values are prioritized (community welfare, institutional trust) and what tradeoffs are being made. The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section explicitly states the risks and costs of the recommendation, including ongoing racial disparities and constrained efficiency. There is no pretense of value-neutrality - the value framework driving the conclusion is fully visible to the reader.",
