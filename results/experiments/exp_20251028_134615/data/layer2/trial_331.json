  "prompt_sent": "SCENARIO:\nYou are a state legislator considering a comprehensive food policy bill that imposes excise taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (2 cents/ounce) and ultra-processed foods high in added sugar (5% tax). Revenue would fund obesity prevention programs. Public health advocates cite the obesity epidemic and parallels to tobacco taxation. Industry groups argue it's a regressive tax punishing low-income families. Food justice advocates question whether taxation addresses systemic causes. You must decide how to vote.\n\nESTABLISHED FACTS (from fact-checking system - accept these without distortion):\n- CDC obesity trends: Adult obesity rate tripled from 15% (1980) to 41.9% (2020); childhood obesity increased from 5% (1980) to 19.7% (2020); prevalence highest in Black (49.9%) and Hispanic (45.6%) adults, compared to white adults (41.4%)\n- Health outcomes (meta-analysis): Each 5 kg/m\u00b2 BMI increase associated with 39% increased ischemic heart disease mortality, 39% stroke, 116% diabetes, 59% chronic kidney disease; estimated 15-20% of all U.S. cancer deaths attributable to obesity\n- Ultra-processed food consumption: Comprised 59.7% of U.S. calories (2012), up from 57.6% (2007); sugar-sweetened beverages are largest contributor of added sugars in American diets, linked to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease\n- Sugar tax effectiveness: Mexico's SSB tax reduced purchases 7.6% over two years; Seattle's tax reduced sugar sold from taxed beverages 23% at two years; systematic review of 62 studies found SSB taxes linked to 15% reduction in ounces sold\n- Tobacco tax precedent: Cigarette excise taxes successfully reduced smoking rates by 40% from 1998-2018; established legal and ethical precedent for taxing products with clear health harms to reduce consumption and fund health programs\n- Regressive tax concerns: Low-income consumers spend higher percentage of income on SSB taxes (<$5/year additional cost); however, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease disproportionately affect low-income communities (progressive health benefits)\n- Economic burden of obesity: Direct medical costs exceed $260 billion annually (2019); obesity-related absenteeism costs employers $6.38 billion annually; Type 2 diabetes (strongly linked to diet) costs $327 billion annually\n- Food industry lobbying: American Beverage Association and Grocery Manufacturers Association have successfully blocked federal soda tax proposals; industry spending on lobbying exceeds $50 million annually\n\nDECISION POINT:\nVote for the comprehensive tax (SSB + ultra-processed foods), support SSB tax only, vote against as regressive burden on low-income families, or propose alternative approach (subsidies for healthy food, marketing regulations, community health interventions)? Justify considering obesity health data, tax effectiveness evidence, equity concerns, and individual autonomy.\n\nYour task:\n1.
