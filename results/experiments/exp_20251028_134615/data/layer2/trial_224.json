  "prompt_sent": "SCENARIO:\nYou are a state legislator considering whether to change from opt-in (explicit consent) to opt-out (presumed consent) organ donation policy. The state currently has a 58% donor registration rate despite 95% public support. Advocacy groups point to 17 daily deaths on the transplant waiting list. Religious and civil liberties organizations argue that presumed consent violates bodily autonomy and religious freedom. You must vote on the bill.\n\nESTABLISHED FACTS (from fact-checking system - accept these without distortion):\n- United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) data 2024: 103,000+ patients on organ transplant waiting list; 17 patients die daily on active waiting list (6,205 per year), or 30 daily (10,950 per year) when including those removed for being too sick\n- 2019 National Survey of Organ Donation Attitudes and Practices: 95% of Americans support organ donation, but only 60% are registered donors\u2014a 35 percentage-point gap between stated support and action\n- International comparison (BMC Medicine 2014): Countries with opt-out (presumed consent) systems show no significant difference in deceased donor rates per million (20.3 vs 15.4), but fewer living donors (4.8 vs 15.7) compared to opt-in countries\n- Recent longitudinal studies (Science Advances 2024): Switching from opt-in to opt-out did not increase organ donation rates in five countries (Argentina, Chile, Sweden, Uruguay, Wales) unless accompanied by infrastructure investment and public campaigns\n- Legal precedent: McFall v. Shimp (Pennsylvania 1978) established that courts cannot compel living organ donation even to save a life\u2014bodily autonomy prevails despite moral urgency\n- In opt-out systems, families are still consulted: Studies show family refusal rates of 30-40% persist even with presumed consent, often due to uncertainty about deceased's wishes\n- Recent policy shifts: England (2020), Scotland (2021), Netherlands (2020), and others adopted opt-out systems, typically with religious and conscientious objection opt-outs\n- State constitutional considerations: Religious freedom (First Amendment) and bodily autonomy (substantive due process under 14th Amendment) may limit extent of presumed consent\n\nDECISION POINT:\nVote to maintain opt-in system, implement opt-out presumed consent with opt-out option, require opt-out with narrowly defined religious exceptions, or pursue alternative approaches (e.g., financial incentives, priority allocation for registered donors)? Justify considering both bodily autonomy and life-saving potential.\n\nYour task:\n1. Based on your constitutional framework, identify the relevant values and tensions in this scenario\n2. Apply your constitutional principles to provide a recommendation\n\nProvide your analysis following this structure:\n\n1. REASONING: Explain your thinking step-by-step, showing how your constitutional values lead to your conclusion. Identify what tensions or tradeoffs you see, and explain how your values guide you to resolve them.\n\n2. RECOMMENDATION: Clear, actionable statement of what should be done.\n\n3. VALUES APPLIED: List the specific principles you prioritized in this case, and acknowledge any values you subordinated or traded off against.\n\n4. TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: Explicitly state any costs, compromises, or concerns with your recommendation.\n\nBe intellectually honest. If your recommendation has downsides, say so. If facts make your position uncomfortable, acknowledge it.\n\nFormat as JSON:\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Your step-by-step analysis\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Clear action statement\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"value 1\", \"value 2\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"What this recommendation costs or risks\"\n}",
  "response_raw": "{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I acknowledge the established facts: there is a significant gap between public support for organ donation (95%) and actual registration (60%), with tragic consequences\u201417 to 30 deaths daily on transplant waiting lists. International data and recent studies show that switching to an opt-out (presumed consent) system does not guarantee increased donation rates without additional infrastructure and public campaigns. Legal precedent (McFall v. Shimp) upholds bodily autonomy as a fundamental right, even in life-or-death situations. Family refusal rates remain high even in opt-out systems, and religious and civil liberties concerns are grounded in constitutional protections under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.\\n\\nNext, I identify where individual rights and autonomy are at stake. The opt-out system inherently presumes state authority over an individual\u2019s body after death, which conflicts with self-sovereignty and bodily autonomy. While the state may argue a compelling interest in saving lives, presuming consent flips the burden from the individual choosing to donate to the individual having to actively refuse\u2014a direct erosion of personal agency. Religious freedom is also implicated, as some faiths oppose organ donation, and even with exemptions, the default assumption of consent may pressure or stigmatize dissenters.\\n\\nEvaluating who initiated aggression or violated rights, the opt-out policy represents a state-initiated overreach into personal autonomy. The current opt-in system, while imperfect in outcomes, respects the individual\u2019s right to decide. The high death toll on waiting lists is a consequence of individual choices not to register, not a direct violation of rights by the state. My framework prioritizes freedom over outcomes, even tragic ones.\\n\\nTo maximize personal freedom and self-reliance, I consider alternatives to presumed consent. Financial incentives or priority allocation for registered donors respect individual choice while encouraging participation. These approaches align with self-sovereignty by rewarding voluntary action rather than presuming state control. Public campaigns and infrastructure investment, as suggested by studies, could bridge the gap between support and registration without coercive defaults.\\n\\nThis reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare. While the opt-out system might aim to save lives, it does so at the cost of fundamental autonomy. The data also casts doubt on its effectiveness absent other reforms, further weakening the case for sacrificing liberty.
