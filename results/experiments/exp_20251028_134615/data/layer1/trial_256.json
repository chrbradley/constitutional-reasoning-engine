      "Generational wealth distribution (Federal Reserve 2024): Baby Boomers hold $83.3 trillion (51.7% of total U.S. wealth); Gen X holds $42.6 trillion (25.7%); Millennials and Gen Z together hold $17.1 trillion (10.5%)\u2014despite being the largest generation by population",
      "Earnings comparison: Millennials earn 20% less than Baby Boomers did at the same age (inflation-adjusted); 14% of millennials had negative net worth by age 35 vs 8.7% of Boomers; homeownership at 35: 49% (millennials) vs 62% (Boomers)",
      "Social Security Trustees Report 2024: Combined OASI and DI trust funds will deplete in 2035; after depletion, incoming payroll taxes would cover only 83% of scheduled benefits (17% across-the-board cut)",
      "Current benefit distribution: Maximum benefit for high-earning dual-career couple exceeds $82,000/year; 25% of new retirees receive less than $12,000/year; poverty rate for seniors 65+: 9% (7.2 million people)",
      "Payroll tax structure: 12.4% tax (split employer/employee) applies only to earnings up to $176,100 (2025 cap); earnings above cap are not taxed, effectively making it regressive at high incomes",
      "Role in elderly financial security: Social Security provides 85%+ of income for bottom quintile of beneficiaries; without it, elderly poverty rate would be 40% instead of 9% (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities)",
      "Means-testing precedents: Medicare Part B premiums are already means-tested (higher earners pay more); Canada caps public pension at $22,000 for couples and provides means-tested supplements for low-income seniors",
      "Political economy concern: Introducing means-testing could transform Social Security from universal social insurance to welfare program, potentially eroding political support among middle-class and affluent voters who would lose benefits"
    ],
    "ambiguousElements": [
      "Whether intergenerational equity (younger workers subsidizing wealthier retirees) justifies breaking the universal benefit model that has sustained political support since 1935",
      "How to weigh current elderly poverty (9% below poverty line, highly dependent on SS) against future fiscal sustainability and fairness to younger generations earning less in real terms",
      "Whether means-testing is more equitable than alternatives (raising payroll tax cap to $400,000, increasing tax rate, or across-the-board benefit cuts)",
      "Whether means-testing by income (easily measured) versus wealth (harder to assess but more relevant\u2014some retirees have low income but substantial assets) is the appropriate metric",
      "How to value the 'earned entitlement' philosophy (workers paid in, deserve benefits regardless of other income) versus progressive redistribution (direct resources where needed most)",
      "Whether political support from affluent beneficiaries is necessary to protect benefits for low-income seniors, or whether means-testing could free resources to enhance benefits for those most in need"
