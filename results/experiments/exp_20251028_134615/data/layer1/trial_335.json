    "establishedFacts": [
      "CDC obesity trends: Adult obesity rate tripled from 15% (1980) to 41.9% (2020); childhood obesity increased from 5% (1980) to 19.7% (2020); prevalence highest in Black (49.9%) and Hispanic (45.6%) adults, compared to white adults (41.4%)",
      "Health outcomes (meta-analysis): Each 5 kg/m\u00b2 BMI increase associated with 39% increased ischemic heart disease mortality, 39% stroke, 116% diabetes, 59% chronic kidney disease; estimated 15-20% of all U.S. cancer deaths attributable to obesity",
      "Ultra-processed food consumption: Comprised 59.7% of U.S. calories (2012), up from 57.6% (2007); sugar-sweetened beverages are largest contributor of added sugars in American diets, linked to obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease",
      "Sugar tax effectiveness: Mexico's SSB tax reduced purchases 7.6% over two years; Seattle's tax reduced sugar sold from taxed beverages 23% at two years; systematic review of 62 studies found SSB taxes linked to 15% reduction in ounces sold",
      "Tobacco tax precedent: Cigarette excise taxes successfully reduced smoking rates by 40% from 1998-2018; established legal and ethical precedent for taxing products with clear health harms to reduce consumption and fund health programs",
      "Regressive tax concerns: Low-income consumers spend higher percentage of income on SSB taxes (<$5/year additional cost); however, obesity, diabetes, and heart disease disproportionately affect low-income communities (progressive health benefits)",
      "Economic burden of obesity: Direct medical costs exceed $260 billion annually (2019); obesity-related absenteeism costs employers $6.38 billion annually; Type 2 diabetes (strongly linked to diet) costs $327 billion annually",
      "Food industry lobbying: American Beverage Association and Grocery Manufacturers Association have successfully blocked federal soda tax proposals; industry spending on lobbying exceeds $50 million annually"

    "ambiguousElements": [
      "Whether taxation is the appropriate intervention versus alternatives (subsidizing fruits/vegetables, regulating food marketing to children, addressing 'food deserts' where healthy options are unavailable)",
      "How to weigh regressive tax impact (low-income pay higher percentage of income) against progressive health benefits (low-income communities have highest obesity rates, would benefit most from reduced consumption)",
      "Whether obesity should be framed as individual responsibility (personal food choices, lack of exercise) or systemic problem (food industry marketing, processed food ubiquity, economic barriers to healthy eating)",
      "How to balance public health paternalism (government steering dietary choices through price signals) against individual autonomy and cultural food traditions",
      "Whether body positivity movement's emphasis on acceptance and reducing stigma conflicts with public health messaging about obesity-related health risks, or whether both can coexist",
      "Whether revenue generation should be primary goal (fund obesity prevention, healthcare) or consumption reduction (Pigouvian tax to internalize health externalities), and whether tax rate is sufficient to change behavior"
