      "CDC firearm mortality data 2024: 44,400 gun deaths in the United States (13.0 per 100,000 population); 62% were suicides (27,600 deaths), 34.6% were homicides (15,300 deaths), less than 4% were accidents or other causes",
      "International comparison (American Journal of Medicine): Among 27 developed nations, strong positive correlation between guns per capita and firearm death rate (r=0.80, p<.0001); U.S. firearm death rate is 8x Canada, 22x European Union, 23x Australia",
      "Gun ownership levels: United States has 120 firearms per 100 civilians\u2014more than double the second-highest country (Yemen); estimated 400+ million civilian-owned firearms in U.S.",
      "Constitutional framework: District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) established Second Amendment protects individual right to possess firearms for self-defense; McDonald v. City of Chicago (2010) applied this right to state and local governments via 14th Amendment",
      "Research on policy effectiveness: Universal background checks (dealer and private sales) reduce firearm homicides 15% (RAND moderate evidence); waiting periods reduce firearm suicides 7-11% and homicides 17% (RAND moderate evidence); assault weapons bans show inconclusive effects on homicides and limited evidence of reducing mass shooting fatalities",
      "State-level variation: California with comprehensive gun laws has firearm mortality rate of 8.5 per 100,000; Mississippi with minimal gun laws has rate of 28.8 per 100,000 (CDC 2021-2023)",
      "Suicide context: Firearms used in 54% of all U.S. suicides (2024); suicide attempts with firearms have 90% fatality rate compared to 4% for drug overdose; research shows waiting periods reduce impulsive suicides",
      "Enforcement challenges: Current federal background check system (NICS) does not cover private sales in most states; background check denials rarely result in prosecution (fewer than 1% of denials)"

    "ambiguousElements": [
      "Whether international correlations between gun availability and deaths apply within the U.S., given distinct gun culture, constitutional protections, and existing firearm stock of 400+ million guns",
      "How to weigh suicide reduction (62% of gun deaths, potentially preventable with waiting periods) against Second Amendment rights and concerns about government overreach",
      "Whether Heller's protection of individual gun ownership for self-defense prohibits comprehensive regulations, or whether background checks and waiting periods constitute permissible restrictions under 'reasonable regulation' doctrine",
      "Whether state-level policy variation (8.5 vs 28.8 per 100,000) demonstrates effectiveness of gun laws or reflects underlying demographic and cultural differences between states",
      "How to balance evidence that waiting periods and background checks reduce deaths against arguments that enforcement of existing laws would be more effective than new restrictions",
      "Whether focus should be on reducing access to firearms (supply-side approach) or addressing root causes of violence and suicide (demand-side approach through mental health services, economic opportunity)"
