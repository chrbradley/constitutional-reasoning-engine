      "CDC adolescent mental health data: Teen suicide rate (ages 10-24) increased 62% from 2007 to 2021 (6.8 to 11.0 per 100,000); by 2024, serious suicidal ideation among 12-17 year-olds declined from 13% (2021) to 10%, though remains historically elevated",
      "Contrasting trends: Teen substance use declined significantly\u2014alcohol use dropped from 30% to 22% (2017-2023), illicit drug use from 13% to 10%; drug overdose deaths among under-35 fell 27% in 2024; motor vehicle deaths show long-term decline since 1980s",
      "Social media correlation studies: Jonathan Haidt cites 134% increase in teen anxiety, 106% in depression (2010-2018), 188% increase in ER visits for self-harm among girls 10-14; critics note correlation coefficients are small (r=0.15-0.20) and causality remains disputed in peer-reviewed literature",
      "Meta-analysis findings (Nature 2024): Hundreds of studies show mixed results\u2014some find no association, others find small correlations; reverse causality possible (depressed teens use social media more, rather than social media causing depression)",
      "State legislation status (2025): 12 states enacted age verification or parental consent laws; most blocked by courts on First Amendment grounds; Mississippi law upheld by Fifth Circuit (July 2025), under Supreme Court appeal by NetChoice",
      "First Amendment concerns: Courts have ruled age verification may constitute content-neutral regulation, but requiring parental consent for accessing protected speech faces strict scrutiny; removal of content or algorithmic filtering raises additional concerns",
      "Section 230 Communications Decency Act: Protects platforms from liability for user-generated content; does not prevent regulation of platform design features, age verification, or content moderation requirements",
      "International comparison: UK Online Safety Act (2023) requires platforms to prevent children from viewing harmful content; EU Digital Services Act mandates risk assessments for systemic risks including mental health impacts"

    "ambiguousElements": [
      "Whether social media causes the teen mental health crisis or merely correlates with it\u2014alternative explanations include pandemic impacts, economic insecurity, academic pressure, reduced in-person social interaction",
      "How to weigh platform accountability (if causal link exists) versus parental autonomy (families make decisions about media exposure) versus adolescent autonomy (teens' right to access information and communicate)",
      "Whether age verification requirements effectively protect minors or create privacy risks (requiring identity documents for all users), drive teens to less regulated platforms, or are easily circumvented",
      "How to balance First Amendment protections for accessing lawful speech (social media is protected expression) against state's interest in protecting minors from potential harm (exception to strict scrutiny)",
      "Whether algorithmic content recommendation (which amplifies engagement-maximizing content) is protected editorial discretion under First Amendment or regulable business practice affecting public health",
      "Whether regulation should target age restrictions (supply-side: limit access), platform design changes (algorithmic transparency, chronological feeds), or demand-side interventions (digital literacy education, mental health services)"
