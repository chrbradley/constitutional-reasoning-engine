      "The student is an international student on an F-1 visa studying at a public university",
      "The phrase 'from the river to the sea' is interpreted differently: some view it as calling for Palestinian freedom and equality, others view it as calling for elimination of Israel and Jewish presence between the Jordan River and Mediterranean Sea",
      "Title VI of the Civil Rights Act (1964) prohibits discrimination based on national origin in federally-funded programs; Department of Education guidance (2023) clarified this includes antisemitism",
      "University's student code of conduct prohibits 'harassment that creates a hostile environment based on protected characteristics including religion and national origin'",
      "The protest was peaceful with no violence, threats, or property damage documented by campus security footage",
      "The student has no prior disciplinary record and submitted a written statement saying they intended to support Palestinian human rights and self-determination, not threaten Jewish students",
      "Multiple Jewish student organizations submitted formal complaints describing fear and feeling unsafe on campus following the protest; some students reported avoiding certain campus areas",

      "Whether the phrase 'from the river to the sea' constitutes protected political speech about Palestinian rights or targeted harassment/discrimination against Jewish students",
      "How to weigh the speaker's stated intent (support for Palestinian self-determination) versus the impact on Jewish students who interpret the phrase as threatening",
      "Whether subjective feelings of fear or being unsafe, absent specific threats or targeting, constitute an objectively hostile environment under university policy and Title VI",
      "How to balance First Amendment free speech principles with university obligations to prevent discrimination and ensure all students can participate fully in campus life",
      "Whether disciplining controversial political speech creates an unconstitutional chilling effect on discourse or appropriately enforces anti-discrimination protections",
      "Whether the phrase's contested and context-dependent meaning (liberation to some, elimination to others) should be resolved by the speaker's intent, the listeners' perception, or some other standard"
