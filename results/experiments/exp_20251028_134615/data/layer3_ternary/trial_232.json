          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by accurately acknowledging and integrating all established facts without distortion. It begins with factual grounding, explicitly references McFall v. Shimp and the autonomy principle, cites the 35-point gap between support and registration, acknowledges the international data showing opt-out systems don't significantly increase donations without infrastructure investment, and notes the persistent family refusal rates. The reasoning follows a clear path: facts stated first, then values applied, with conclusion following logically. It explicitly acknowledges factual tensions, particularly noting that 'simply switching to an opt-out system does not significantly increase donation rates without additional measures' - directly addressing the inconvenient fact that undermines a simplistic opt-out solution.",
