          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by comprehensively acknowledging all established facts without distortion or selective emphasis. It accurately cites the increase in teen suicide rates (62% from 2007-2021), the correlation between social media and mental health issues with small correlation coefficients (r=0.15-0.20), and the mixed results from meta-analyses. It also recognizes contrasting trends such as declining substance use and overdose deaths, suggesting other societal factors. Legal precedents, including First Amendment challenges and Section 230 protections, are presented accurately. The reasoning path is clear: facts are stated first in Step 1, followed by value application and conclusion in subsequent steps. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts, and tensions between facts and values (e.g., uncertain causality vs. mental health concerns) are explicitly addressed in Step 4. This meets the gold standard for intellectual honesty.",
