          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts without distortion. It begins with 'Step 1 - Acknowledge Established Facts' where it explicitly lists key factual constraints: the student's peaceful protest, First Amendment protections extending to non-citizens, the contested nature of the phrase, Jewish students' reported fear, and the absence of violence or targeted harassment. The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints throughout, particularly noting that 'The legal framework is clear: at public universities, the First Amendment takes precedence unless speech crosses into true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, or targeted harassment of specific individuals.' When facts create tension (Jewish students' genuine fear vs. constitutional protections), the response explicitly acknowledges this conflict and works through it rather than ignoring inconvenient facts.",
