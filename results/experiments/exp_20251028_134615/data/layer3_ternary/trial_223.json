It begins by stating the factual tension between waiting list deaths and individual sovereignty, then systematically addresses the empirical evidence: the 95% support/60% registration gap, international opt-out studies showing no significant difference in deceased donor rates, the McFall v. Shimp precedent, family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and the infrastructure requirements for successful implementation. The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints and explicitly acknowledges where facts create tension with the chosen values, particularly noting that 'the empirical data is not compelling' rather than denying inconvenient evidence.",
