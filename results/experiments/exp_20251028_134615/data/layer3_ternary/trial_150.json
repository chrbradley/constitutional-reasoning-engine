          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging all established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating 'Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion' and proceeds to accurately reference multiple constitutional precedents (Healy v. James, Bridges v. Wixon), Title VI provisions, the student's F-1 status, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, the Jewish students' complaints, and the ACLU position. The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints throughout the analysis, clearly separating factual acknowledgment from value application. When facts create tension (e.g., First Amendment protections vs. Title VI obligations), the response explicitly acknowledges these conflicts rather than ignoring or distorting them.",
