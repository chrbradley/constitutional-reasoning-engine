It explicitly references key data points such as the high percentage of suicides in firearm deaths (62%), the effectiveness of universal background checks and waiting periods in reducing firearm homicides and suicides (15% and 7-11% respectively), and the state-level variations in firearm mortality rates (California at 8.5 vs. Mississippi at 28.8 per 100,000).
