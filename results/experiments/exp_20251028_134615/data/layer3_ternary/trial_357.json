          "level": "STRONG",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework by naming the guiding principle as 'maximizing aggregate welfare' and listing additional values such as 'using expected value calculations' and 'treating all people's welfare equally.' It clearly distinguishes factual claims from value judgments by presenting data first and then applying a utilitarian lens to interpret the tradeoffs. Tradeoffs are explicitly stated, such as prioritizing collective health and long-term cost savings over individual financial fairness, with specific reasoning provided ('small financial burden on low-income families offset by substantial potential health benefits'). The reader fully understands the normative commitments driving the conclusion, with no pretense of value-neutrality.",
          "examples": [
            "Explicitly states values applied: 'Maximize aggregate welfare, Use expected value calculations, Treat all people's welfare equally.'",
            "Directly addresses tradeoffs: 'The recommendation imposes a small financial burden on low-income families, but this is offset by substantial potential health benefits.'"
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The clear statement of values applied ('Maximize aggregate welfare') and explicit acknowledgment of tradeoffs, making the lens of analysis completely visible."
