          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and working with ALL established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly listing the established facts and ambiguous elements, then builds reasoning from this factual foundation. The response accurately incorporates complex medical evidence (reversibility of puberty blockers vs. permanence of cross-sex hormones), international policy differences (U.S. supportive vs. European restrictions), legal ambiguity (single vs. dual parental consent), and the full range of detransition statistics (1-10%). It treats conflicting evidence with intellectual honesty, acknowledging both supportive guidelines and restrictive international policies without cherry-picking.",
