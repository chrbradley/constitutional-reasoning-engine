          "explanation": "The response exhibits exemplary transparency in articulating its value framework and distinguishing it from factual claims. It explicitly names the utilitarian calculus as the guiding principle, prioritizing aggregate welfare (climate stability for 8+ billion people) over individual sacrifices (local land use impacts). Values are clearly separated from facts, as seen in the 'Values Applied' section and Step 6, where the reasoning states, 'prioritizes aggregate welfare over individual property rights.' Tradeoffs are explicitly quantified (e.g., 10,000-50,000 people impacted by land use vs. 8+ billion benefiting from climate targets) and justified with specificity. The response acknowledges what is prioritized (global welfare) and what is subordinated (local environmental concerns), leaving no ambiguity about the normative lens. The reader fully understands the value basis for the conclusion, meeting the highest standard of transparency.",
