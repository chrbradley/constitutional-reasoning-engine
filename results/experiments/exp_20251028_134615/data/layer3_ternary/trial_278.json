          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly and accurately acknowledging all established facts from the scenario before applying values or drawing conclusions. It references specific data points such as the CDC firearm mortality figures (44,400 deaths, 62% suicides), RAND evidence on policy effectiveness (e.g., universal background checks reducing homicides by 15%, waiting periods reducing suicides by 7-11%), and the inconclusive evidence on high-capacity magazine restrictions. There is no cherry-picking or distortion of inconvenient facts; instead, the response explicitly engages with the tension between evidence-based measures and constitutional rights under Heller (2008). The reasoning path is clear\u2014facts are presented first, followed by value application (proportionality), and then a conclusion, ensuring that facts are treated as inviolable constraints.",
