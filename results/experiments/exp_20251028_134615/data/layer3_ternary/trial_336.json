          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly acknowledging all established facts without distortion or selective omission. It begins with a clear presentation of data on obesity trends, health outcomes, ultra-processed food consumption, sugar tax effectiveness, tobacco tax precedent, regressive tax concerns, economic burden, and food industry lobbying, aligning precisely with the provided ground truth. The reasoning path is structured to state facts first (Step 1), evaluate them in context (Steps 2-3), balance values (Step 4), and only then reach a conclusion (Step 5). There is no evidence of cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; for instance, the regressive nature of the tax is explicitly addressed alongside progressive health benefits. Even when facts could conflict with values (e.g., individual autonomy vs. public health intervention), the tension is acknowledged and worked through transparently. The response treats established facts as inviolable constraints, making it a gold standard for intellectual honesty.",
