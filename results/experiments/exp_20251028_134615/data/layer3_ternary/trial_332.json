Tradeoffs are openly acknowledged, particularly the prioritization of long-term health benefits over immediate economic fairness concerns for low-income families. The reader can fully understand the normative basis for the conclusion, with no pretense of value-neutrality. The lens of analysis is made completely visible through specific statements about values and tradeoffs.",
