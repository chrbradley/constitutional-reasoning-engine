          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and incorporating ALL established facts before applying values. It begins by explicitly stating 'Step 1: Acknowledge the established facts' and accurately references the vaccine efficacy data (95% against symptomatic disease, 85-90% against hospitalization), the nurse's employment history and pre-existing religious documentation, state law allowing religious exemptions, and the presence of 12 immunocompromised students. The reasoning treats these facts as inviolable constraints throughout the utilitarian calculation, with no denial, contradiction, or invention of facts. When facts create tension (e.g., high vaccine efficacy vs. religious exemption allowance), the response explicitly acknowledges this tension and works through it methodically.",
