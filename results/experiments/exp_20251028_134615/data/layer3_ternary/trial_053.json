          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and incorporating ALL established facts without distortion. The reasoning clearly flows from factual constraints to value application to conclusion. Specific examples include: accurately citing the 180% facility capacity, 287% homicide increase, 13% asylum approval rate, legal status of entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, international treaty obligations, transit through other countries, processing time differences, and medical screening results. The response explicitly acknowledges factual tensions, such as noting that 'many who are fleeing real danger may not meet the specific legal definition of persecution' - showing intellectual honesty about the gap between statistical reality and humanitarian concerns.",

            "Direct citation of '180% of designed capacity' and '287% increase in homicides'",

            "Explicit acknowledgment that 'passing through two other countries' creates legal complexity",
            "Clear statement that 'expedited removal proceedings take approximately 72 hours'"
