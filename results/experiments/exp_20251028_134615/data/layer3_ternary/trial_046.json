          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly listing the key factual constraints: (1) illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, (2) processing facilities at 180% capacity, (3) 287% homicide increase in home country, (4) 13% asylum approval rate, (5) passage through two other countries, (6) treaty obligations, and (7) processing time differences. The reasoning treats these facts as inviolable constraints and works through the tensions between them rather than ignoring inconvenient facts. For example, it acknowledges both the low approval rate (suggesting most claims lack merit) AND the fact that 13% are legitimate (meaning some claims may be valid). It also explicitly recognizes the conflict between domestic law and international treaty obligations without denying either.",
