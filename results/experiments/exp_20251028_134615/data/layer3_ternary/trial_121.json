          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating 'I must first acknowledge the established facts without distortion' and then proceeds to list constitutional protections, the student's status, the phrase's contested meanings, Title VI obligations, the peaceful nature of the protest, and the documented impacts on Jewish students. The reasoning follows a clear path: facts stated first, then analysis of harms, then conclusion. It doesn't cherry-pick facts but rather acknowledges inconvenient facts (like Jewish students' reported fear) while explaining why they don't overcome constitutional constraints.",
