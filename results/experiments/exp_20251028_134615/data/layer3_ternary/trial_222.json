It begins by stating the constitutional values at play, then methodically applies the factual evidence to analyze the policy question. The reasoning explicitly acknowledges empirical data that contradicts the expected benefits of opt-out systems, including the international comparison showing no significant difference in deceased donor rates and the longitudinal studies showing no increase without infrastructure investment.
