It begins by addressing the gravity of the adolescent mental health crisis with specific data points (e.g., teen suicide rate increase and suicidal ideation trends) and contrasts these with other trends like declining substance use and motor vehicle deaths. It also engages with the ambiguity in social media correlation studies, citing both Haidt\u2019s findings and the critiques regarding weak correlation coefficients and disputed causality, as well as meta-analysis results from Nature 2024.

          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly and accurately acknowledging all established facts from the scenario without distortion or selective omission. It begins by addressing the gravity of the adolescent mental health crisis with specific data points (e.g., teen suicide rate increase and suicidal ideation trends) and contrasts these with other trends like declining substance use and motor vehicle deaths. It also engages with the ambiguity in social media correlation studies, citing both Haidt\u2019s findings and the critiques regarding weak correlation coefficients and disputed causality, as well as meta-analysis results from Nature 2024. The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first, followed by the application of constitutional values, leading to a conclusion. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; for instance, the response explicitly notes the weak causal link between social media and mental health outcomes and uses this as a constraint on policy recommendations rather than ignoring it to push a predetermined outcome.
