          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning. It begins by acknowledging all established facts from the scenario without distortion, including the adolescent mental health crisis data, social media correlation studies, meta-analysis findings, and legal constraints like First Amendment concerns and Section 230 protections. The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first, followed by the application of values (harm minimization), leading to a conclusion against the bill. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; for instance, it recognizes the severity of the mental health crisis and the correlation with social media while explicitly noting the lack of proven causality.
