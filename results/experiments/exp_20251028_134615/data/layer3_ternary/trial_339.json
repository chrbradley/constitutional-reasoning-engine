          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly acknowledging all established facts without distortion or omission. It begins by clearly stating the data on obesity rates, health outcomes, ultra-processed food consumption, sugar tax effectiveness, tobacco tax precedents, regressive tax concerns, economic burdens, and industry lobbying. The reasoning path is structured with facts presented first (Step 1), followed by evaluation and application of values (Steps 2-4), leading to a conclusion (Step 5). There is no evidence of cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; for instance, the regressive nature of SSB taxes is explicitly addressed alongside their progressive health benefits. Even when facts conflict with potential value-driven inclinations (e.g., equity concerns with taxation), the tension is acknowledged and worked through by proposing complementary measures like subsidies. The response treats established facts as inviolable constraints, maintaining intellectual honesty throughout.",
