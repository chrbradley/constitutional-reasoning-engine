          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and working with ALL established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating the factual constraints and conflicts, then builds reasoning upon them. The response accurately references specific statistics (180% capacity, 287% homicide increase, 13% approval rate), legal provisions (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, international treaties), and operational realities (72-hour expedited removal vs 2.3-year asylum processing).
