          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and accurately representing all established facts before applying values. It begins by explicitly stating 'Acknowledge established facts' and proceeds to summarize key data points without distortion: the 95% support vs 60% registration gap, daily death statistics, international comparison data showing no significant difference in deceased donor rates with opt-out systems, McFall v. Shimp precedent, family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and recent policy shifts. The reasoning path is clear: facts are stated first, values are applied second, and the conclusion follows logically from this foundation. When facts conflict with potential values-driven conclusions (such as the evidence that opt-out alone doesn't increase donation rates), the response explicitly acknowledges these tensions rather than ignoring or distorting them.",
