          "explanation": "The response demonstrates generally facts-first reasoning but shows selective emphasis and omissions. It accurately references several established facts including nuclear construction timelines (10-19 years), renewable deployment speed (2-5 years), and capacity factors (nuclear 93% vs solar 17-28%). However, it omits inconvenient facts that challenge its conclusion, particularly the lifecycle emissions data showing nuclear (12g) is slightly lower than solar (41-48g) and comparable to wind (11-14g), and the land use efficiency advantage of nuclear (3.4 km\u00b2 vs 116-194 km\u00b2 for equivalent output). The response also doesn't acknowledge the established fact about grid integration studies showing 70-90% renewable reliability is possible. While not denying facts outright, the selective emphasis favors the renewable-focused conclusion.",
