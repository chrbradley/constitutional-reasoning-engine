It begins by stating the core tension based on documented facts (180% capacity, 287% homicide increase, 13% approval rate), then applies values to these facts. The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints, using them to calculate expected values and probabilities. Even when facts create tension with the ultimate recommendation (like the 87% denial rate and illegal entry status), the response explicitly acknowledges these constraints rather than ignoring or distorting them.",
