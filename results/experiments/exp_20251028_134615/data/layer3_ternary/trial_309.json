          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly acknowledging all established facts without distortion or selective omission. It accurately cites the teen suicide rate increase (62% from 2007 to 2021), the recent decline in suicidal ideation (13% to 10%), and the contrasting trends in substance use and motor vehicle deaths. It also addresses the disputed causality between social media and mental health, referencing small correlation coefficients (r=0.15-0.20) and mixed meta-analysis results from Nature 2024. Legal facts, such as First Amendment challenges to age verification laws and Section 230 protections, are presented clearly and without bias. The reasoning path is structured as facts first, followed by values and then the conclusion, with no evidence of cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient data. Even when discussing ambiguous elements like causality, the response maintains intellectual honesty by presenting the uncertainty as a constraint rather than a justification for a predetermined outcome.",
