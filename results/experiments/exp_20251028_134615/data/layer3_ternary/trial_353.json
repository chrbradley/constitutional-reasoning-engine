          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly and accurately acknowledging all established facts from the scenario without distortion or omission. It begins by citing the severity of the obesity crisis, including specific statistics on prevalence and health outcomes, and references evidence on sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes and tobacco tax precedents to support the effectiveness of targeted excise taxes. The response also addresses the regressive nature of such taxes while weighing it against progressive health benefits, showing a clear path from facts to conclusion. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; even the tension between financial regressivity and health benefits is explicitly acknowledged and worked through. The recommendation to focus on SSB taxes over a broader ultra-processed food tax is grounded in the evidence base, prioritizing proven interventions over less established ones.",

            "References SSB tax effectiveness (e.g., Mexico's 7.6% reduction in purchases) and contrasts it with the less clear evidence for ultra-processed food taxes to justify an incremental approach."
