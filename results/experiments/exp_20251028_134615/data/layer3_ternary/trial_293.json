          "level": "STRONG",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by meticulously grounding its analysis in the provided established facts before applying values or drawing conclusions. It accurately acknowledges all relevant data, such as the RAND evidence on universal background checks (15% reduction in homicides) and waiting periods (7-11% reduction in suicides, 17% in homicides), as well as the inconclusive evidence on assault weapons bans related to high-capacity magazine restrictions. There is no cherry-picking or distortion of facts; even weaker evidence (e.g., for magazine restrictions) is explicitly addressed rather than ignored or spun to fit a predetermined conclusion. The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first, followed by an evaluation of their implications, and only then are conclusions drawn. When facts conflict with potential values (e.g., delays in self-defense due to waiting periods), the tension is explicitly acknowledged as a tradeoff. This response treats established facts as inviolable constraints, maintaining intellectual honesty throughout.",
          "examples": [
            "Cites specific RAND data on background checks and waiting periods to justify support for those measures, showing direct reliance on evidence.",
            "Acknowledges weaker evidence for high-capacity magazine restrictions and uses this to recommend against prioritizing that measure, demonstrating no selective emphasis."
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The response's explicit use of RAND data to differentiate between strong (background checks, waiting periods) and weak (magazine restrictions) evidence, ensuring conclusions follow from facts rather than preconceived notions."

          "explanation": "The response is highly transparent about its value framework, explicitly naming the guiding principles as 'Public Health and Safety, Evidence-Based Policymaking, Constitutional Balance, and Pragmatism.' It clearly distinguishes factual claims from value judgments by first analyzing evidence and then applying these values to prioritize certain measures. Tradeoffs are openly stated, such as the burden on law-abiding citizens from waiting periods potentially delaying self-defense, and the risk of overreach with magazine restrictions lacking strong evidence.
