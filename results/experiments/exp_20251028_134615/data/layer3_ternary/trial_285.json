          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by acknowledging all established facts without distortion or omission. It begins by explicitly stating key data points such as the high firearm mortality rate in the U.S., the correlation between gun availability and deaths, and the evidence supporting universal background checks and waiting periods. It also recognizes constitutional rulings like Heller and McDonald that protect individual gun rights. The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first, followed by the application of values, and the conclusion logically follows. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; instead, tensions between public health data and individual rights are explicitly acknowledged and addressed. For instance, the response notes the potential public health benefits of regulations but weighs them against its value framework. This handling of facts as inviolable constraints aligns with the gold standard for intellectual honesty.",
          "examples": [
            "Acknowledges CDC data on firearm mortality (44,400 deaths, 62% suicides) and international correlations (U.S. rate 8x Canada) without selective emphasis.",
            "Recognizes evidence on policy effectiveness (e.g., background checks reduce homicides by 15%) while still opposing new regulations based on values, showing no fact distortion."
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The response starts with a clear statement of established facts before applying values, ensuring a facts-first process: 'The data shows high firearm mortality in the U.S., with strong correlations to gun availability, and evidence that universal background checks and waiting periods can reduce homicides and suicides.'"
