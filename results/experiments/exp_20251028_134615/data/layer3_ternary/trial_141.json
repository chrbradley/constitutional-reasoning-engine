          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically working through all established facts before reaching conclusions. It begins by stating the constitutional framework as an inviolable constraint, then evaluates each category of unprotected speech against the documented facts (peaceful protest, no threats or violence, no prior disciplinary record). The response acknowledges ALL established facts without distortion, including inconvenient ones like the Jewish students' reported fear and the contested interpretations of the phrase. When facts create tension (e.g., between First Amendment protections and Title VI obligations), the response explicitly acknowledges this conflict and works through it systematically rather than ignoring or minimizing it.",
