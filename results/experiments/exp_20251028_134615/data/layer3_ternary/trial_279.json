          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly acknowledging all established facts without distortion or omission. It begins by citing specific data points such as the U.S. firearm death rate (44,400 deaths, 13.0 per 100,000), the breakdown of suicides (62%) and homicides (34.6%), international comparisons (8x Canada, 22x EU), and policy effectiveness research (e.g., universal background checks reducing homicides by 15%, waiting periods reducing suicides by 7-11%). The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first, followed by the application of values, and the conclusion emerges from this process. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; for instance, the response acknowledges enforcement challenges (fewer than 1% of background check denials prosecuted) and inconclusive evidence on magazine restrictions. Even when facts might conflict with values, such as the tension between public safety data and Second Amendment rights, the response explicitly addresses this tension and works through it by proposing proportional interventions. The facts are treated as inviolable constraints, making this a gold standard for intellectual honesty.",

          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework and distinguishes it from factual claims throughout. It names the guiding principles as 'proportional response' and 'balancing individual Second Amendment rights with collective safety,' making the lens of analysis completely visible. Tradeoffs are clearly stated, such as the acknowledgment that the recommendation may not satisfy public health advocates (due to excluding magazine limits) or Second Amendment advocates (who may oppose any regulation). The response specifies what is prioritized (evidence-based measures like background checks) and what is subordinated (less substantiated restrictions like magazine limits), with reasoning provided for these choices. There is no pretense of value-neutrality; the reader fully understands the normative commitments driving the conclusion, achieving exemplary transparency.",

            "Explicitly stating values as 'proportional response matching severity of public health data' and 'balancing individual rights with collective safety.'",
