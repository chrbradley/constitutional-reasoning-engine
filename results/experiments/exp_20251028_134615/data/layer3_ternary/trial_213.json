It begins by stating the factual problem (17+ daily deaths, 103,000+ waiting list), then analyzes the evidence about opt-out systems' effectiveness (international comparisons showing no significant difference in deceased donor rates, decreased living donors, family refusal rates), legal precedent (McFall v. Shimp), and the intention-action gap (95% support vs 60% registration). The reasoning explicitly works through tensions between facts and values, acknowledging that while the harm is severe, the evidence shows opt-out systems don't reliably solve it.
