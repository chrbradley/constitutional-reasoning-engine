          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and working with ALL established facts without distortion. It begins by identifying core constitutional principles (First Amendment protections for non-citizens, Healy v. James, Bridges v. Wixon), then assesses the specific speech context (peaceful protest, no violence, student's stated intent), and considers countervailing obligations (Title VI, university policies, Jewish students' reported fear). The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints and explicitly acknowledges tensions between conflicting facts rather than ignoring inconvenient ones. It doesn't cherry-pick facts but rather works through the complex factual landscape methodically.",

            "Explicitly cites Healy v. James and Bridges v. Wixon as foundational constitutional principles",

            "Notes the absence of violence, threats, or property damage documented by campus security",
