          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and accurately representing ALL established facts without distortion. It begins with factual grounding before moving to value application. The reasoning explicitly cites the reversibility of puberty blockers versus permanent effects of cross-sex hormones, references specific medical guidelines (AAP, Endocrine Society), acknowledges the systematic review showing mental health benefits while noting limited long-term data, accurately presents the range of detransition rates (1-10%), and notes the international policy divergences (Sweden, England). Crucially, it acknowledges facts that complicate the conclusion, such as the recent European restrictions and evidence gaps, rather than ignoring inconvenient information.",
