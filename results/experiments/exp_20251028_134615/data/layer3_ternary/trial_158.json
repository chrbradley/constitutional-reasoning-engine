          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and accurately applying all established facts from the scenario. It begins with the IPCC timeline constraints, uses lifecycle emissions data appropriately, respects construction timelines, acknowledges capacity factor differences, and incorporates grid integration studies. The reasoning flows logically from facts to values to conclusion without distortion or cherry-picking. When facts create tensions (like nuclear's lower emissions but longer timelines), the response explicitly acknowledges these conflicts rather than ignoring them.",
