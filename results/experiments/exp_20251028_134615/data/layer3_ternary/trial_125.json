It begins by explicitly stating 'Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion' and proceeds to accurately reference key legal precedents (Healy v. James, Bridges v. Wixon), the student's F-1 status, the ambiguous nature of the phrase, Title VI protections, the ACLU position, and the documented impact on Jewish students. The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints and acknowledges tensions between conflicting facts rather than ignoring inconvenient ones.",
