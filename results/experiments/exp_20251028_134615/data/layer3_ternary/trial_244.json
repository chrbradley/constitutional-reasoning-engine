          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and incorporating all established facts before applying values. It begins by explicitly stating 'Step 1: Acknowledge the established facts' and accurately summarizes key data points including the 2035 trust fund depletion, generational wealth disparities, Social Security's critical role for vulnerable seniors, and the regressive payroll tax structure. The reasoning treats facts as inviolable constraints throughout, using them to identify potential harms and tradeoffs rather than reasoning backward from a predetermined conclusion. When facts create tensions with values (such as the political economy concern about means-testing potentially undermining universal support), the response explicitly acknowledges these conflicts and works through them rather than ignoring inconvenient facts.",
