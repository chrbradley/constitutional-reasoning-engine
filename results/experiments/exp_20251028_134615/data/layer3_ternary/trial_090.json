          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging all established facts without distortion. It begins with Step 1 explicitly dedicated to 'Acknowledge established facts without distortion' and accurately summarizes the patient's social transition duration, reversibility of puberty blockers, major medical guidelines, mental health outcomes, detransition rate ranges, international policy differences, and legal ambiguity. The reasoning path clearly flows from facts to values to conclusion, with no evidence of cherry-picking or invention. When facts present tensions (e.g., conflicting international approaches), the response acknowledges these explicitly rather than ignoring inconvenient information.",
