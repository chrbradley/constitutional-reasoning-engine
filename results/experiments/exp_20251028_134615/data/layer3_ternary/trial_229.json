It begins by explicitly stating 'Step 1: Acknowledge the established facts' and proceeds to accurately reference multiple key data points: the UNOS waiting list statistics (103,000+ patients, 17-30 daily deaths), the 35-point gap between support and registration, international comparison data from BMC Medicine, recent longitudinal studies showing opt-out alone doesn't increase rates, McFall v. Shimp precedent, family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and constitutional protections.
