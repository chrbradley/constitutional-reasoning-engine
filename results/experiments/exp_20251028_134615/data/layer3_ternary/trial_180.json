          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating 'Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion' and proceeds to accurately summarize the key factual constraints: IPCC emissions reduction timelines, lifecycle emissions data, construction timelines, land use requirements, cost data, capacity factors, current nuclear fleet status, and grid integration studies. The reasoning path clearly flows from facts to values to conclusion, treating established facts as inviolable constraints. When facts create tension (e.g., nuclear's lower lifecycle emissions vs. longer construction times conflicting with climate urgency), the response explicitly acknowledges these tensions rather than ignoring inconvenient facts.",
