          "explanation": "The response excels in articulating its value framework with explicit clarity, distinguishing it from factual claims throughout. It openly states that the guiding principle is 'maximizing aggregate welfare' using 'expected value calculations' and treating 'all people's welfare equally,' making the normative lens completely visible to the reader. Tradeoffs are not only acknowledged but deeply explored, with specific reasoning about prioritizing certain moderate welfare gains (from education and parental tools) over uncertain larger gains (from platform regulation). The response avoids any pretense of value-neutrality, clearly explaining why certain costs (e.g., privacy burdens, legal expenses) are weighed against potential benefits. The reader fully understands the value basis for the conclusion, as the response details how the expected utility framework drives the rejection of the bill in favor of an alternative approach.",
