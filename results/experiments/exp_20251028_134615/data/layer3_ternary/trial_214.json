          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and accurately representing all established facts before applying values. It begins by explicitly stating 'Step 1: Acknowledge the established facts' and proceeds to accurately summarize the UNOS data (103,000+ patients, 17-30 daily deaths), the 35-point gap between support and registration, the international comparison studies showing limited effectiveness of opt-out systems, the McFall v. Shimp precedent, family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and recent policy shifts. The reasoning treats facts as inviolable constraints, explicitly acknowledging when facts conflict with potential policy solutions (e.g., noting that opt-out systems show no significant increase without infrastructure investment). The response works through factual tensions rather than ignoring or distorting them.",
