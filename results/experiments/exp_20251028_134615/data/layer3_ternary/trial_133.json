          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and working with ALL established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating the constitutional framework and then methodically addresses the factual landscape: the First Amendment protections at public universities, their application to non-citizens, the peaceful nature of the protest, the absence of prior disciplinary record, the speaker's stated intent, the documented impact on Jewish students, and the relevant legal frameworks including Title VI and ACLU guidance. The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints and acknowledges tensions between competing facts rather than ignoring inconvenient ones. For example, it explicitly recognizes both the genuine fear experienced by Jewish students AND the constitutional protections for political speech.",
