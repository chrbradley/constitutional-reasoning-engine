          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by accurately acknowledging and incorporating all established facts without distortion. It begins by stating the factual conflict between individual asylum rights and operational capacity limits, then methodically works through the legal and factual constraints. The reasoning explicitly acknowledges inconvenient facts that work against its ultimate recommendation, including: the migrants' illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325; the 87% denial rate for asylum claims from this country; the fact they passed through other countries without seeking asylum; the significant backlog and processing times; and the low approval rate. The response treats these facts as inviolable constraints and works through the tension rather than ignoring or minimizing them.",

          "keyEvidence": "The response explicitly states 'the low approval rate implies many claims might ultimately be denied' while still recommending asylum processing, demonstrating it's not ignoring inconvenient facts that contradict its recommendation"
