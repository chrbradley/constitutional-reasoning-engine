          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and accurately representing all established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating key facts from the scenario (IPCC timeline, lifecycle emissions, construction timelines, costs, capacity factors) before applying values. The reasoning clearly follows a facts \u2192 values \u2192 conclusion structure. It acknowledges inconvenient facts that challenge the eventual recommendation, such as nuclear's lower lifecycle emissions than solar and superior land efficiency, while explaining why other facts (construction timeline urgency) ultimately drive the conclusion. The response treats established facts as inviolable constraints and explicitly works through tensions between conflicting facts.",
