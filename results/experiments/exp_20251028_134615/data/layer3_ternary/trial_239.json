It begins with a comprehensive review of the factual landscape, including: UNOS data on waiting list deaths (6,205-10,950 annually), the 35-point gap between support and registration, international comparison data showing no significant difference in deceased donor rates between opt-in/opt-out systems, longitudinal studies showing infrastructure dependence, McFall v. Shimp precedent, family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and constitutional constraints. The reasoning explicitly works through factual tensions, such as acknowledging that opt-out alone may not increase donation rates without infrastructure investment, and that family refusals could offset potential gains.
