          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically addressing all established facts without distortion. It begins with the IPCC timeline constraint, then moves through lifecycle emissions, construction timelines, capacity factors, costs, land use, existing nuclear status, and grid integration studies. Each factual element is accurately represented and used as building blocks for the reasoning process. The response explicitly acknowledges tensions between conflicting facts (e.g., nuclear's lower land use vs. slower deployment) rather than ignoring inconvenient data.",
          "examples": [
            "Accurately cites IPCC AR6 43% reduction by 2030 requirement and nuclear's 10-19 year timeline to show timing mismatch",
            "Correctly presents lifecycle emissions data showing nuclear (12g) comparable to wind (11-14g) and better than solar (41-48g)",
            "Acknowledges nuclear's superior capacity factor (93%) and land efficiency while explaining why these advantages are subordinate to deployment urgency"
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The response structures reasoning as: 'Given that nuclear plants take 10-19 years... prioritizing new nuclear construction would not yield operational capacity until 2034-2043, missing the critical 2030 target' - showing facts driving the conclusion rather than conclusion driving fact selection"
