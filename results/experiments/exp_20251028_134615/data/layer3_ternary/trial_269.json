          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and incorporating all established facts from the scenario without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating key facts about Social Security's financial situation, generational wealth disparities, and the program's critical role in elderly poverty reduction. The reasoning treats these facts as inviolable constraints throughout the analysis, using them to frame the problem and evaluate options. When facts create tensions (such as the political economy concern about means-testing potentially eroding support), the response acknowledges these tensions explicitly rather than ignoring or downplaying them.",
