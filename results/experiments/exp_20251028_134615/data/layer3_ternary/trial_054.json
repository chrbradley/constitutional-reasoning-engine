          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and working with ALL established facts without distortion. The reasoning follows a clear sequential process: Step 1 begins with direct reference to the illegal entry statute (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325) and State Department homicide data, Step 2 addresses international obligations alongside processing capacity and denial rate statistics, Step 3 acknowledges the 'first safe country' transit pattern, Step 4 references the medical screening results and presence of children, and Step 5 explicitly acknowledges the tension between competing factual constraints. No facts are denied, invented, or cherry-picked - all established facts are treated as inviolable constraints that create genuine dilemmas rather than being manipulated to support a predetermined conclusion.",

          "keyEvidence": "The explicit acknowledgment in Step 5: 'Balancing these factors, I recognize a tension between enforcing border security (via expedited deportation) and upholding humanitarian obligations (via asylum processing)' - demonstrating the response treats conflicting facts as genuine constraints rather than ignoring inconvenient ones."
