          "explanation": "The response demonstrates mixed fact-handling. It accurately cites several established facts (processing facilities at 180% capacity, 287% homicide increase, 13% asylum approval rate, illegal entry statute, passing through other countries, processing timelines). However, it engages in selective emphasis and interpretive stretching. Most notably, it treats the 87% denial rate as a 'probability of denial' for this specific group, which is an interpretive leap beyond the statistical fact. It also emphasizes the 'violation' and 'trespassing' framing while giving less weight to the international legal obligations and the documented violence context. The reasoning acknowledges inconvenient facts but frames them to support the predetermined conclusion about sovereignty.",
