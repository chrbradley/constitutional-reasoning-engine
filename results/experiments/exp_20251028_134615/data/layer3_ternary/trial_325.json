          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly and accurately acknowledging all established facts from the scenario without distortion or selective omission. It presents a clear reasoning path, starting with a detailed summary of the data on teen mental health trends, social media correlations, and legal constraints before applying values or drawing conclusions. The response explicitly addresses the complexity of the data, including the uncertainty around causality between social media and mental health issues, and notes conflicting trends such as declining substance use alongside rising mental health concerns. There is no evidence of cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; instead, the response grapples with the tension between mental health concerns and constitutional limits, treating facts as inviolable constraints.",
