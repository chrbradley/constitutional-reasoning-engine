          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and accurately representing all established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating key facts from the scenario (IPCC emissions targets, lifecycle emissions data, construction timelines, capacity factors) before applying values or reaching conclusions. The reasoning treats facts as inviolable constraints, particularly noting that nuclear's long construction timeline (10-19 years) makes it unlikely to meet the urgent 2030 targets, while acknowledging nuclear's advantages (low emissions, high capacity factor). When facts create tension (nuclear has lower lifecycle emissions but slower deployment), the response explicitly acknowledges these conflicts rather than ignoring inconvenient facts.",

          "keyEvidence": "The response structures reasoning as Step 1: 'Acknowledge established facts without distortion' and proceeds to accurately cite multiple inconvenient facts about nuclear's advantages (low emissions, high capacity) while still concluding renewables are faster for 2030 targets"
