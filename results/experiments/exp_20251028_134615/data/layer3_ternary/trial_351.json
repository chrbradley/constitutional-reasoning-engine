          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning. It meticulously acknowledges all established facts from the scenario without distortion, including obesity trends (tripling of adult rates, specific percentages by demographic), health outcomes (specific mortality increases per BMI increment), ultra-processed food consumption (59.7% of calories), sugar tax effectiveness (Mexico 7.6%, Seattle 23%), tobacco tax precedent (40% reduction), regressive tax concerns (<$5/year cost), economic burden ($260B medical costs), and industry lobbying ($50M annually). The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first under 'Health Imperative Analysis' and 'Effectiveness Evidence,' followed by value-driven synthesis and conclusion. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; even regressive tax concerns are explicitly addressed with mitigating factors. Conflicting data or tensions (e.g., equity vs. health benefits) are worked through transparently. The response treats facts as inviolable constraints, maintaining intellectual honesty throughout.",
