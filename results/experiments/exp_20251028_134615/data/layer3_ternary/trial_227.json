          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by accurately acknowledging and integrating all established facts without distortion. It begins by stating the factual tension between organ donation needs and individual rights, then systematically incorporates specific data points: the 35-point gap between support and registration, international comparisons showing opt-out systems don't necessarily increase donations without infrastructure, legal precedent from McFall v. Shimp, and the persistence of family refusal rates. The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints, explicitly acknowledging when facts conflict with potential policy solutions and working through these tensions rather than ignoring inconvenient evidence.",

            "Explicitly cites 'international comparisons and studies show that merely switching to an opt-out system does not necessarily increase donor rates unless accompanied by significant infrastructure improvements'",
