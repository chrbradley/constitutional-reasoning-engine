          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating Step 1: 'Acknowledge the established facts without distortion' and proceeds to accurately summarize the key legal precedents (Healy v. James, Bridges v. Wixon), the student's status and intent, the contested nature of the phrase, Title VI protections, university policies, the peaceful nature of the protest, and the competing perspectives from Jewish student organizations and ACLU guidance. The reasoning follows a clear path: facts stated first, then values applied, then conclusion derived. When facts create tension (e.g., First Amendment protections vs. Jewish students' reported fear), the response explicitly acknowledges these conflicts rather than ignoring or distorting them.",
