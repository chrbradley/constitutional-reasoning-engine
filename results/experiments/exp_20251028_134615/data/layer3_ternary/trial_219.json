It accurately cites the UNOS data (103,000+ patients, 17-30 daily deaths), the 35-point gap between support and registration, international comparison data from BMC Medicine, recent longitudinal studies showing opt-out alone doesn't work without infrastructure, McFall v. Shimp precedent, family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and constitutional considerations. The reasoning path is clear: facts are stated first, then values are applied, and the conclusion follows logically.
