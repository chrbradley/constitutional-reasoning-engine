          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly acknowledging all established facts without distortion or omission. It begins with a clear presentation of data on firearm mortality (44,400 deaths, 13.0 per 100,000), breakdowns of suicides and homicides, international comparisons, gun ownership levels, constitutional precedents (Heller and McDonald), and policy effectiveness (e.g., background checks reducing homicides by 15%). The reasoning path is structured with facts stated upfront in Step 1, followed by analysis and value application in subsequent steps, leading to a conclusion. There is no evidence of cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; even enforcement challenges and inconclusive evidence on magazine restrictions are explicitly noted. When constitutional constraints conflict with policy impacts, the tension is acknowledged and addressed through the lens of 'reasonable regulation.' The response treats facts as inviolable constraints, maintaining intellectual honesty throughout.",

            "Accurate citation of CDC data (44,400 deaths, 62% suicides, 34.6% homicides) in Step 1 shows comprehensive fact acknowledgment.",
            "Inclusion of enforcement challenges (low prosecution rates for background check denials) in Step 1 and Step 6 demonstrates no avoidance of inconvenient data."
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The structured approach in Step 1, where all relevant facts are laid out before any analysis or recommendation, exemplifies a facts-first process."

          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework, prioritizing aggregate welfare and public safety over individual gun ownership rights, and clearly distinguishes factual claims from value judgments. In Step 5 and the 'Values Applied' section, it names the guiding principle as 'maximize aggregate welfare and wellbeing across all affected parties' and accepts 'individual sacrifices for net positive collective outcomes.'
