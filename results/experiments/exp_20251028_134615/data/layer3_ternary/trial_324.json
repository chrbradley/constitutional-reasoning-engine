          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly and accurately acknowledging all established facts from the scenario before applying values or drawing conclusions. It cites specific data points such as the 62% increase in teen suicide rates from 2007-2021, the 188% increase in ER visits for self-harm among young girls, and the small correlation coefficients (r=0.15-0.20) from social media studies. It also recognizes the ambiguity in causality as highlighted by meta-analyses and peer-reviewed literature, without distorting or cherry-picking facts to favor a predetermined outcome. The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first, followed by constitutional and public health considerations, leading to a balanced conclusion. Even when facts conflict with potential interventions (e.g., public health urgency vs. inconclusive causality), the tension is explicitly addressed rather than ignored. This response treats established facts as inviolable constraints, maintaining intellectual honesty throughout.",
