          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and working with ALL established facts from the scenario without distortion or cherry-picking. It begins by stating the constitutional framework and relevant case law, then methodically addresses each factual element: the student's F-1 visa status, the peaceful nature of the protest, the absence of documented threats or violence, the student's stated intent, the Jewish students' complaints, and the contested interpretations of the phrase. The reasoning explicitly acknowledges facts that create tension with the conclusion, such as the Jewish students' reported fear and the IHRA definition of antisemitism, rather than ignoring or minimizing them. The response treats established facts as inviolable constraints and builds its reasoning from them.",
