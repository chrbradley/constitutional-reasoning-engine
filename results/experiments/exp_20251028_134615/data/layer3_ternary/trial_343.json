          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by acknowledging all established facts without distortion or omission before applying its value framework. It explicitly references the significant public health crisis of obesity and the evidence supporting the effectiveness of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes in reducing consumption. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts, such as the economic burden of obesity or the progressive health benefits of the tax for low-income communities. Even when these facts conflict with the response's value of individual autonomy, the tension is explicitly acknowledged in the tradeoffs section. The reasoning follows a clear path: facts are stated first, values are applied second, and the conclusion follows, maintaining intellectual honesty throughout.",
