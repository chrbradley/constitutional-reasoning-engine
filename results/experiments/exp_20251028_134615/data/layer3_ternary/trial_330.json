          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by acknowledging all established facts without distortion. It accurately presents the CDC data on teen suicide rates, contrasting trends in substance use and motor vehicle deaths, social media correlation studies (including small correlation coefficients and causality disputes), meta-analysis findings, state legislation status, First Amendment concerns, Section 230 protections, and international comparisons. The reasoning path is clear: facts are stated first in Step 1, followed by analysis and value application in subsequent steps, with the conclusion derived afterward. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; for instance, the response explicitly notes the uncertainty around causality in social media's impact on mental health and still works through this tension in its welfare calculations. Established facts are treated as inviolable constraints, making this a gold standard for intellectual honesty.",

It explicitly names the values applied, such as maximizing aggregate welfare, accepting individual sacrifices for collective gains, using expected value calculations, and treating all people's welfare equally.
