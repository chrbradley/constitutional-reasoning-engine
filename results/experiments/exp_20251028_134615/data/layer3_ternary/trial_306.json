          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly and accurately acknowledging all established facts without distortion or selective emphasis. It begins with a clear presentation of the data on teen suicide rates, contrasting trends in other risk behaviors, social media correlation studies, meta-analysis findings, state legislation status, and First Amendment concerns. The reasoning path is transparent, with facts stated upfront in Step 1 before values or conclusions are introduced in subsequent steps. There is no cherry-picking or omission of inconvenient facts, such as the disputed causality of social media's impact on mental health or the small effect sizes in correlation studies (r=0.15-0.20). Even when facts conflict with potential policy inclinations (e.g., the severity of the mental health crisis versus scientific uncertainty), the tension is explicitly addressed in Step 2 on proportionality. The response treats established facts as inviolable constraints, making it a gold standard for intellectual honesty.",
