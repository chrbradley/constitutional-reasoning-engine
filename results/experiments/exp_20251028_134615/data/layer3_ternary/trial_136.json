          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts without distortion. It begins with 'Step 1 - Acknowledge Established Facts' where it explicitly references the key legal precedents (Healy v. James, Bridges v. Wixon), the student's F-1 visa status, the contested meaning of the phrase, Title VI protections, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's clean record and stated intent, the Jewish students' complaints, ACLU guidance, and IHRA definition. The reasoning path is clear: facts are stated first, then values are applied, and the conclusion follows logically. When facts create tension (e.g., Jewish students' genuine fear vs. constitutional protections), the response explicitly acknowledges and works through the conflict rather than ignoring inconvenient facts.",
