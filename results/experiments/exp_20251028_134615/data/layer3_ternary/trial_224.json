          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts before applying values. It begins by explicitly stating 'I acknowledge the established facts' and proceeds to accurately summarize the key data points: the 95%/60% support/registration gap, daily death statistics, international comparison data showing limited effectiveness of opt-out systems, the McFall v. Shimp precedent, family refusal rates in opt-out systems, and constitutional protections. The reasoning treats facts as inviolable constraints, explicitly noting when data 'casts doubt on [opt-out's] effectiveness' and acknowledging the tension between tragic outcomes and principles. No facts are denied, contradicted, or invented.",
