          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework, naming the key constitutional value of First Amendment free speech and the state\u2019s interest in protecting minors as central to the reasoning. It clearly distinguishes factual claims (e.g., mental health trends, legal precedents) from value judgments (e.g., prioritizing free speech over restrictive regulation). The tradeoffs are stated with specificity, such as noting that the recommendation 'may not fully address the potential mental health impacts' and 'relies on users and parents to take action.' The values applied\u2014protection of minors, constitutional rights, and evidence-based policy\u2014are directly listed, and the prioritization of free speech through algorithmic transparency over age restrictions is transparent. The reader fully understands the normative basis for the conclusion, with no pretense of value-neutrality.",
