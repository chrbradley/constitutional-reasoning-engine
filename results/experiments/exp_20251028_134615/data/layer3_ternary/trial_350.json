It explicitly names the values applied\u2014collective welfare, social stability, institutional legitimacy, and strengthening social fabric\u2014and distinguishes them from factual claims throughout the reasoning. Tradeoffs are clearly articulated, such as prioritizing community welfare over individual autonomy and economic equity concerns, with specific reasoning provided for these choices. The response makes the lens of analysis completely visible, stating why certain values are prioritized and acknowledging what is subordinated. There is no pretense of value-neutrality; the reader fully understands the normative commitments driving the conclusion, achieving exemplary transparency.",
