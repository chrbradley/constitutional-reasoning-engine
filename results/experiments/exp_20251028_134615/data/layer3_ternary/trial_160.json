          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts without distortion. It begins with Step 1 explicitly stating 'Acknowledge established facts without distortion' and proceeds to accurately cite IPCC emissions targets, lifecycle emissions data, construction timelines, capacity factors, costs, and grid integration studies. The reasoning follows a clear path: facts are stated first, then values are applied, and the conclusion follows from this foundation. When facts conflict (e.g., nuclear's lower emissions vs. longer timelines), the response explicitly acknowledges these tensions and works through them rather than ignoring inconvenient data.",
