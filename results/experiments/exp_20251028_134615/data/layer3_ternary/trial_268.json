          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and incorporating all established facts from the scenario before applying values. It begins by explicitly stating key facts about the Social Security trust fund depletion, generational wealth disparities, and the program's role in preventing elderly poverty. The reasoning then builds logically from these facts to identify affected parties and evaluate options. Crucially, it acknowledges inconvenient facts that complicate the preferred solution, such as the political economy concern about means-testing potentially eroding broad support, and explicitly works through this tension rather than ignoring or dismissing it.",
