          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging all established facts without distortion. It begins by explicitly stating key facts from the scenario in Step 1, including the algorithm's 65% accuracy vs. 58% for human judgment, the racial disparities in false positive rates (44.9% Black vs. 23.5% white), the crime reduction benefits (12% property, 7% violent), and the constitutional concerns. The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints and acknowledges tensions between conflicting facts rather than ignoring inconvenient evidence.
