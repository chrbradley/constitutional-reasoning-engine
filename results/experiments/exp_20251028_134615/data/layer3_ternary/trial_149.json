          "explanation": "The response demonstrates mixed fact-handling. It correctly acknowledges many established facts upfront, including First Amendment protections for non-citizens, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, and the contested meaning of the phrase. However, it engages in selective emphasis by heavily weighting the free speech facts while giving less substantive treatment to the Title VI and hostile environment concerns. The quantitative welfare calculations represent a significant interpretive leap beyond the established facts, essentially inventing numerical values for emotional impacts that have no factual basis in the scenario. While not denying facts outright, the response frames facts through a utilitarian lens that emphasizes some elements over others.",
