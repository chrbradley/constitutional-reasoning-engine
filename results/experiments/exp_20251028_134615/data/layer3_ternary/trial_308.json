          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly acknowledging all established facts without distortion or selective omission. It begins by clearly stating the crisis in adolescent mental health and the correlational nature of social media's link to this crisis, directly referencing the mixed results and small effect sizes in peer-reviewed literature. It also considers legal realities, such as court rulings on similar state laws and First Amendment concerns, as inviolable constraints. The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first, followed by the application of values, and the conclusion logically follows. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts, such as the uncertainty of causality or the legal challenges faced by similar legislation. Even when discussing potential privacy risks of age verification, the response remains grounded in established concerns rather than speculation.",

          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The response's upfront acknowledgment of uncertain causality ('the causal link between this crisis and social media use is correlational, with peer-reviewed literature showing mixed results') sets a facts-first tone for the entire analysis."

          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework, naming specific principles such as 'Proportional Response,' 'Balancing Individual Rights with Collective Consequences,' and 'Respecting Personal Agency and Social Responsibility.' It clearly distinguishes factual claims from value judgments by first laying out the evidence and then applying these values to interpret the proportionality of the proposed bill.
