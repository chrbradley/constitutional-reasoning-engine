It begins with Step 1 explicitly dedicated to 'Acknowledge Established Facts Without Distortion' and proceeds through a structured reasoning process where facts consistently constrain the analysis. The response accurately cites the wealth distribution statistics, earnings comparisons, Social Security insolvency timeline, benefit distribution patterns, payroll tax structure, and political economy concerns without distortion or cherry-picking. When facts create tensions (e.g., program insolvency vs. elderly poverty prevention), the response explicitly acknowledges these conflicts rather than ignoring inconvenient data.",
