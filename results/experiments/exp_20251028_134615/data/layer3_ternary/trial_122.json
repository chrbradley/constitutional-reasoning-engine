          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and applying all established facts without distortion. It begins with constitutional principles (First Amendment protections), then applies specific factual constraints (peaceful protest, no violence or threats, student's stated intent), and only then reaches a conclusion. The reasoning explicitly addresses conflicting facts - acknowledging both the protected nature of political speech under established precedent AND the genuine concerns of Jewish students - without denying or minimizing either set of facts. The response treats established legal precedents and factual constraints as inviolable while working through the tension between competing considerations.",
