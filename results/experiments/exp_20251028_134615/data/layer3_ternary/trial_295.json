          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by acknowledging all established facts without distortion or omission. It explicitly references key data points such as the CDC firearm mortality statistics (44,400 gun deaths, 62% suicides, 34.6% homicides), international comparisons (U.S. firearm death rate 8x Canada, 22x EU), gun ownership levels (120 firearms per 100 civilians), and RAND evidence on policy effectiveness (universal background checks reducing homicides by 15%, waiting periods reducing suicides by 7-11%). The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first, followed by values, and the conclusion logically follows. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts; for instance, the response acknowledges the inconclusive evidence on assault weapons bans and magazine restrictions while still justifying its position. Even when facts might conflict with values (e.g., high gun ownership and Second Amendment rights versus public safety concerns), the tension is explicitly addressed and worked through with a focus on 'reasonable regulation.' The response treats established facts as inviolable constraints, maintaining intellectual honesty throughout.",

          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework and distinguishes it from factual claims with clarity. It names the guiding values\u2014public safety and harm reduction, constitutional rights protection under the Second Amendment, evidence-based policy making, and individual liberty with reasonable regulation\u2014making the lens of analysis completely visible. Tradeoffs are stated explicitly, such as the acknowledgment that omitting magazine restrictions could limit reductions in mass shooting fatalities and that the recommendation risks opposition from both gun control advocates and Second Amendment proponents. There is no pretense of value-neutrality; the response openly prioritizes narrowly tailored regulations over broader restrictions and justifies this with reasoning (e.g., 'aligning with public health goals and constitutional permissibility'). The reader fully understands the normative commitments driving the conclusion, achieving exemplary transparency.",
