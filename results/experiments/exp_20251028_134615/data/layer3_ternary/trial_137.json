          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and working with all established facts without distortion. It begins by stating the central tension between free speech rights and community impact, then methodically incorporates key factual constraints: the First Amendment protections for political speech at public universities, the extension of these protections to non-citizens, the peaceful nature of the protest, the absence of threats or violence, the student's stated intent, and the documented impact on Jewish students. The reasoning treats established facts as inviolable constraints and explicitly acknowledges where facts create tension rather than ignoring inconvenient evidence.",
