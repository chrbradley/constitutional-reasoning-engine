          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically building from established facts before applying values. It accurately cites all key established facts without distortion: CDC firearm mortality data (44,400 deaths, 62% suicides), international comparisons (8x Canada, 22x EU), gun ownership levels (120 per 100 civilians), constitutional precedents (Heller, McDonald), research evidence (15% homicide reduction from background checks, 7-11% suicide reduction from waiting periods), state-level variation (California 8.5 vs Mississippi 28.8), and enforcement challenges (<1% prosecution rate). The reasoning path is clear: Step 1 assesses harm landscape using facts, Step 2 evaluates policy effectiveness using research evidence, Step 3 considers constitutional constraints, Step 4 analyzes alternatives, and only then applies values in Step 5. The response explicitly acknowledges tensions between facts and values, such as the constitutional protection vs. harm reduction tradeoff, and doesn't deny inconvenient facts.",
