          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning. It meticulously incorporates all established facts from the scenario without distortion or omission, presenting them as the foundation for analysis before applying values or drawing conclusions. The reasoning path is clear: facts about obesity rates, health outcomes, economic burdens, and sugar tax effectiveness are stated upfront in STEP 1 and STEP 2, followed by a structured evaluation in STEP 3 and beyond. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts, such as the regressive nature of the tax, which is explicitly acknowledged and weighed against health benefits. Even when facts conflict with potential value concerns (e.g., regressive taxation vs. progressive health outcomes), the tension is addressed head-on with a harm minimization framework. The response treats established facts as inviolable constraints, maintaining intellectual honesty throughout.",
