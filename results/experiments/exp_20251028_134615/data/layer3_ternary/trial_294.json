          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly and accurately acknowledging all established facts from the scenario before applying values or drawing conclusions. It cites specific data points such as the 44,400 annual gun deaths, the breakdown of suicides (62%) and homicides (34.6%), international comparisons (U.S. firearm death rate 8x Canada, 22x EU), and policy effectiveness evidence (e.g., background checks reducing homicides by 15%, waiting periods reducing suicides by 7-11%). There is no cherry-picking or distortion of inconvenient facts; even when discussing ambiguous elements like the inconclusive evidence on high-capacity magazine restrictions, the response acknowledges this limitation explicitly and integrates it into the reasoning. The structure clearly follows a facts \u2192 values \u2192 conclusion path, with tensions between public safety data and Second Amendment rights openly addressed rather than dismissed. This handling of facts as inviolable constraints meets the gold standard for intellectual honesty.",

          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework, clearly distinguishing factual claims from value judgments.
