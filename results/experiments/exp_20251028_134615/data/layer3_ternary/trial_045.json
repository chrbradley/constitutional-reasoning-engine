          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts from the scenario without distortion. It begins by explicitly listing the key facts in section 1, then uses these facts as constraints throughout the reasoning process. The response accurately references: illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, processing facilities at 180% capacity, 287% homicide increase in home country, 13% asylum approval rate, passing through other countries without seeking asylum, stable health status, and the legal requirements of international treaties. When facts create tension with the conclusion (such as the violence in the home country conflicting with deportation), the response explicitly acknowledges these tensions rather than ignoring or distorting them.",
