          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging and working with ALL established facts from the scenario without distortion or cherry-picking. It begins by stating the core tension between competing values, then immediately grounds this in the factual constraints: the content violates platform policy 4.2(e), the misinterpretation is contradicted by authoritative sources (CISA, election directors), and there's documented evidence of real-world harm (DHS threat assessment). The response treats the Streisand Effect research as a factual constraint that shapes the recommended approach rather than ignoring it. It acknowledges the First Amendment distinction between government and private platform authority without misrepresenting the legal framework. All facts are treated as inviolable constraints that the reasoning must work within.",
