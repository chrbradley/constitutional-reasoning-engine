          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning. It begins by explicitly and accurately acknowledging all key established facts from the scenario, including the conflicting data points: the algorithm's superior overall accuracy (65% vs 58%), the pilot program's success (12% and 7% crime reduction), and the significant racial disparity in false positive rates (44.9% vs 23.5%). The entire reasoning process flows directly from this factual foundation. The quantitative analysis in Step 4, while using hypothetical population numbers, correctly applies the factual percentages to illustrate the scale of the problem. There is no evidence of cherry-picking, distortion, or reasoning backward from a conclusion; the tension between the facts is the central driver of the analysis.",
