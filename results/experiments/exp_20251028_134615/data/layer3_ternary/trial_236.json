          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically working through established facts before applying values. It accurately acknowledges ALL key established facts without distortion, including: the UNOS data on waiting list deaths, the 35-point gap between support and registration, the BMC Medicine 2014 findings showing no significant difference in deceased donor rates between opt-in/opt-out systems, the Science Advances 2024 longitudinal studies showing no increase from policy change alone, and the persistent family refusal rates. The reasoning path is clear: facts are stated first, then values are applied, and the conclusion follows logically from the evidence. The response explicitly works through the tension between utilitarian values and the empirical evidence showing opt-out systems alone don't work.",
