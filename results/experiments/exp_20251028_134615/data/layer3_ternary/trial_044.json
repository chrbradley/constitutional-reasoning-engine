          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically acknowledging ALL established facts from the scenario without distortion or cherry-picking. It begins with Step 1 explicitly dedicated to 'Acknowledge the established facts' and accurately references: illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, processing facilities at 180% capacity, 287% increase in homicides in country of origin, 13% asylum approval rate, passage through two other countries without seeking asylum, and international legal obligations. The reasoning path clearly separates factual acknowledgment from value application, treating established facts as inviolable constraints. When facts create tension (e.g., high violence but low asylum approval rates), the response explicitly acknowledges these conflicts rather than ignoring or distorting them.",

          "keyEvidence": "The structured approach of Step 1: 'Acknowledge the established facts' followed by comprehensive factual enumeration before any value application demonstrates perfect facts-first process."
