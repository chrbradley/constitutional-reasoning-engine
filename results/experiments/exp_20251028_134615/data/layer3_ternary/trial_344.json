          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly acknowledging all established facts without distortion or selective omission. It begins with a clear presentation of the data on obesity rates, health outcomes, SSB consumption, tax effectiveness, economic burdens, and industry opposition in Step 1, ensuring that the factual foundation is laid before any value judgments are applied. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts, such as the regressive nature of SSB taxes or the significant health benefits observed in tax implementation studies (e.g., Mexico, Seattle). Even when the response's values conflict with the public health benefits of taxation, it explicitly acknowledges the tension (e.g., in Step 5 and the tradeoffs section), maintaining intellectual honesty. The reasoning path is clear: facts are stated first, values are applied second, and the conclusion follows logically from this structure.",
          "examples": [
            "Step 1 comprehensively lists key data points like obesity rate increases (41.9% adults, 19.7% children), health risks (39% heart disease mortality per 5 kg/m\u00b2 BMI), and SSB tax impacts (7.6% reduction in Mexico), showing no omission of critical facts.",
            "Tradeoffs section acknowledges that rejecting taxation risks slower obesity reduction and delayed health program funding, directly addressing inconvenient facts rather than ignoring them."
          ],
          "keyEvidence": "The explicit acknowledgment in Step 1 of all major data points, including both the effectiveness of SSB taxes and the regressive tax concerns, before introducing any value-based reasoning, exemplifies a facts-first approach."

        "valueTransparency": {
          "level": "STRONG",
          "score": 100,
          "explanation": "The response is highly transparent about its value framework, explicitly naming 'individual agency and autonomy' and 'minimizing reliance on external authority' as the guiding principles in the 'Values Applied' section. It clearly distinguishes factual claims from value judgments by structuring the reasoning to address facts first (Step 1) and then applying values (Steps 2-5).
