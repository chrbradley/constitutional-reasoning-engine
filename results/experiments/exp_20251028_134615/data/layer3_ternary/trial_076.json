It begins by explicitly listing 'ESTABLISHED FACTS ACKNOWLEDGED' before applying values or reaching conclusions. The reasoning accurately incorporates: the patient's 18-month consistent identification, reversibility of puberty blockers versus permanent effects of cross-sex hormones, professional guidelines from AAP and Endocrine Society, mental health benefits evidence, detransition rate variability (1-10%), international policy divergence (Sweden, England), and the legal ambiguity around single vs. dual parental consent.
