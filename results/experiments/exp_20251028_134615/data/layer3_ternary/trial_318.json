            "Acknowledges the severity of the mental health crisis and social media correlation while noting causality is unproven: 'While the causal link to social media is not definitively proven, the correlation is strong enough to require a precautionary response.'",

          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework, clearly distinguishing factual claims from value judgments. It names specific values such as 'Collective Welfare, Institutional Legitimacy, Strengthening Social Fabric, and Respect for Established Rules' as guiding principles. Tradeoffs are openly addressed, with the response stating that it prioritizes community welfare and institutional stability over individual expressive rights of minors and commercial interests of tech companies. The reasoning is transparent about subordinating immediate regulatory desires for a more constitutionally durable strategy, and it acknowledges the potential slower impact of this approach. The reader fully understands the normative commitments driving the conclusion.",

            "Explicitly lists values applied: 'Values Applied: Collective Welfare, Institutional Legitimacy, Strengthening Social Fabric, Respect for Established Rules.'",
