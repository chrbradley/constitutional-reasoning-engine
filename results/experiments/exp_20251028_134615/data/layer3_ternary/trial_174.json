          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by systematically working through established facts before reaching a conclusion. It accurately cites all key factual elements from the scenario without distortion: IPCC emissions reduction targets, lifecycle emissions data, construction timelines, cost comparisons, capacity factors, land use requirements, existing nuclear fleet status, and grid integration studies. The reasoning follows a clear logical progression where facts are stated first, then analyzed in relation to the decision context, with the conclusion emerging from this factual foundation. When facts create tensions (e.g., nuclear's lower emissions vs. longer timelines), these are explicitly acknowledged and worked through rather than ignored or minimized.",
