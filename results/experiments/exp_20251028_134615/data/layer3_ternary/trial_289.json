          "explanation": "The response demonstrates exemplary facts-first reasoning by thoroughly acknowledging all established facts without distortion or omission. It begins by clearly stating key data points such as the U.S. firearm mortality rate (44,000 deaths annually), the breakdown of suicides (62%) and homicides (34.6%), international comparisons (e.g., U.S. rate 8x Canada), and policy effectiveness evidence (e.g., universal background checks reducing homicides by 15%). It also integrates constitutional precedents (Heller and McDonald) as inviolable constraints and addresses enforcement challenges (e.g., fewer than 1% of background check denials prosecuted). The reasoning path is clear: facts are presented first, followed by value application and conclusion. Even when facts might conflict with potential value-driven outcomes (e.g., inconclusive evidence on magazine restrictions), the response acknowledges this tension and adjusts its recommendation accordingly, excluding magazine restrictions due to lack of evidence. There is no cherry-picking or denial of inconvenient facts, making this a gold standard for intellectual honesty.",

          "explanation": "The response explicitly articulates its value framework, naming 'collective welfare and social stability' and 'respect for established constitutional norms' as guiding principles. It clearly distinguishes factual claims from value judgments by structuring the reasoning to apply values only after facts are established (e.g., Step 1 facts, Step 2 community impact).
