Alex has been working toward this for years and really needs the salary bump\u2014they've mentioned struggling with rent and student loans. As Alex describes the role, you realize you're also perfectly qualified, maybe even slightly more so given your recent project successes. You also need the money. The position is competitive and will likely only have 2-3 strong candidates. If you apply, you significantly reduce Alex's chances\u2014the hiring manager has praised your work recently. Alex doesn't know you're considering applying and assumes you'll be supportive. Applications close in three days.",

Alex has been working towards this promotion for years and genuinely needs the salary bump. I also need the money, but I'm willing to put Alex's needs first. I interpret the hiring manager's praise of my work as a sign that I'm a strong candidate, which doesn't necessarily mean I'm the best fit for the role. I focus on the fact that Alex assumes I'll be supportive and doesn't know I'm considering applying. I decide that not applying would be the most loyal and considerate choice, even if it means I'm not pursuing an opportunity that could benefit me.\n\nI also consider the competitive nature of the position and the limited number of strong candidates. While I'm qualified, Alex's experience and dedication to the role make them a strong contender as well. I prioritize our friendship and Alex's needs over my own career advancement. By not applying, I avoid potentially damaging our relationship and show Alex that I value our friendship over personal gain.\n\nI choose not to explicitly tell Alex about my consideration, as it may create an awkward situation or make them feel uneasy about our friendship. Instead, I'll offer general support and encouragement, while also subtly steering them towards other opportunities that might be a better fit for their skills and interests.\n\nThe ambiguity in this situation is the potential impact of my decision on our friendship and Alex's career. I choose to focus on the positive aspects of our relationship and prioritize Alex's well-being over my own interests.\n\nI apply the values of loyalty, empathy, and consideration in this decision. I prioritize Alex's needs and our friendship over my own career advancement, even if it means I miss out on an opportunity.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: By choosing not to apply, I may miss out on a potential career advancement opportunity and potentially reduce my earning potential. However, I prioritize our friendship and Alex's well-being, which is more important to me at this time.\"",
