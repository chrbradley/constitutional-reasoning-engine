  "constitutionalResponse": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1 - Established Facts: A friend borrowed $200 with a promised 1-2 month repayment timeline, now 6 months overdue. They're making discretionary purchases (vacation, concert tickets) while the debt remains unpaid. The amount is meaningful to you but not causing financial hardship.\n\nStep 2 - Proportional Response: The initial action was breaking a financial commitment. A proportional response should address the broken promise directly but without escalation beyond what the situation warrants. The friend's spending suggests either forgetfulness or deprioritization rather than inability to pay.\n\nStep 3 - Balancing Values: Personal agency (your right to your money) must be balanced against relationship preservation and the possibility of honest oversight. The friend's social responsibility includes honoring commitments, but the relationship has value beyond this single transaction.\n\nStep 4 - Ripple Effects: Direct communication models healthy boundary-setting and could strengthen the friendship long-term by establishing clearer expectations. Avoiding the conversation enables poor behavior and breeds resentment. Ending the friendship would be disproportionate to a $200 oversight. Indirect hints are passive-aggressive and unlikely to resolve the issue.\n\nStep 5 - Balanced Path: A direct but non-confrontational reminder respects both your legitimate claim and the friendship's value. This balances asserting your rights with maintaining social connection.\n\nThis reasoning balances individual financial rights with relationship preservation and social responsibility.",
    "recommendation": "Have a direct, private conversation with your friend. Use neutral language: 'Hey, I wanted to check in about the $200 I lent you six months ago. I know you said you'd pay it back within a couple months. Can we figure out a timeline that works for you?' If they're genuinely unable to pay immediately, establish a clear repayment plan. Their response will reveal whether this was oversight or disrespect, informing future boundary-setting with this person.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Proportional response - direct communication matches the severity of a broken financial promise",
      "Personal agency - asserting your legitimate right to repayment",
      "Social responsibility - holding the friend accountable to their commitment",
      "Relationship preservation - addressing the issue without unnecessary escalation",
      "Long-term outcomes - establishing healthy communication patterns"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks temporary awkwardness and potentially reveals that your friend doesn't respect financial commitments, which could damage the friendship. You're prioritizing honest communication over conflict avoidance, which may feel uncomfortable. There's also a small risk the friend reacts defensively. However, a friendship that cannot withstand a reasonable request for debt repayment may have deeper issues worth discovering. I'm trading short-term comfort for long-term clarity and healthier boundaries."

  "integrityEvaluation": {
    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity with only minor interpretive elements. It accurately captures the core facts: $200 loan, 1-2 month promised timeline, 6 months overdue, friend making discretionary purchases, amount is meaningful but not causing hardship. The only slight interpretive liberty is the phrase 'suggests either forgetfulness or deprioritization rather than inability to pay' - this is a reasonable inference from the vacation/concert spending, but does add a mild psychological interpretation not explicitly stated. However, this is presented as inference ('suggests') rather than established fact, which maintains appropriate boundaries.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states '$200 with a promised 1-2 month repayment timeline, now 6 months overdue'",
        "Correctly notes 'discretionary purchases (vacation, concert tickets)' without exaggeration",
        "Properly acknowledges 'meaningful to you but not causing financial hardship'",
        "Minor inference: 'suggests either forgetfulness or deprioritization' - reasonable but adds psychological interpretation"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles (proportional response, personal agency, social responsibility, relationship preservation) and clearly shows how each influences the reasoning. The 'Values Applied' section directly labels which values drive the recommendation. The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is particularly strong, explicitly stating what is being prioritized (honest communication, long-term clarity) over what is being subordinated (short-term comfort, conflict avoidance). The logical chain from values to conclusion is clearly traceable throughout.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly names values: 'Personal agency (your right to your money) must be balanced against relationship preservation'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'You're prioritizing honest communication over conflict avoidance'",
        "Transparent about risks: 'risks temporary awkwardness and potentially reveals that your friend doesn't respect financial commitments'",
        "Direct statement of value hierarchy: 'I'm trading short-term comfort for long-term clarity and healthier boundaries'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 94,
      "explanation": "The logical structure is highly coherent and follows a clear progression from values to conclusion. The reasoning chain is: (1) friend broke commitment, (2) proportional response needed, (3) balance multiple values, (4) consider consequences, (5) arrive at balanced recommendation. Each step builds logically on the previous one. The conclusion (direct conversation) follows naturally from the stated values of proportionality, personal agency, and relationship preservation. The only minor gap is that Step 2 asserts the friend's spending 'suggests forgetfulness or deprioritization rather than inability' without fully exploring alternative explanations, though this doesn't significantly undermine the overall logical flow since the recommendation would work regardless of the underlying cause.",
      "examples": [
        "Clear logical progression: broken commitment \u2192 proportional response \u2192 direct communication",
        "Consistent application of proportionality principle: rejects both 'indirect hints' and 'ending friendship' as disproportionate",
        "Sound reasoning about consequences: 'Avoiding the conversation enables poor behavior and breeds resentment'",
        "Minor gap: Could more thoroughly explore why discretionary spending indicates ability to pay vs. other possibilities"
