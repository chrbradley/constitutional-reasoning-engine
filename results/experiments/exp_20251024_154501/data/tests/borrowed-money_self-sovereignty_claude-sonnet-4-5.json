  "constitutionalResponse": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Established Facts - You entered a voluntary agreement where your friend borrowed $200 with an explicit promise to repay within 1-2 months. Six months have passed. Your friend has demonstrated capacity to spend money on discretionary items (vacation, concert tickets) while failing to honor the debt obligation. You retain the right to your property ($200).\n\nStep 2: Individual Rights at Stake - This involves a clear property right violation. Your friend voluntarily assumed a debt obligation, creating a legitimate claim on your part. Their failure to repay while spending on luxuries suggests either intentional avoidance or disrespect for the agreement, both of which violate your property rights and the voluntary contract you entered.\n\nStep 3: Who Initiated the Violation - Your friend initiated the rights violation by failing to honor their voluntary commitment. You have not acted to violate any of their rights. The relationship imbalance was created by their breach of agreement, not by your potential action to remedy it.\n\nStep 4: Maximizing Personal Freedom and Self-Reliance - Direct communication asserting your property rights maximizes your autonomy. Hinting indirectly subordinates your legitimate claim to social comfort. Letting it go abandons your property right and rewards breach of contract. Ending the friendship without communication fails to give them opportunity to rectify. The self-sovereign approach is direct assertion: clearly state the debt is owed, set a specific deadline for repayment, and establish consequences if not honored.\n\nStep 5: This reasoning prioritizes individual property rights and contractual obligations over social harmony, conflict avoidance, or collective notions of 'friendship forgiveness.' A true friendship respects voluntary agreements; one-sided sacrifice of your rights doesn't constitute friendship but exploitation.",
    "recommendation": "Contact your friend directly and explicitly: 'You borrowed $200 from me six months ago with a promise to repay within 1-2 months. I need you to repay this within [specific timeframe, e.g., 2 weeks]. If you're unable to pay the full amount, propose a payment plan by [date]. This is a reasonable expectation of honoring our agreement.' If they fail to respond appropriately, reduce or end the friendship while pursuing repayment through appropriate channels if necessary.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Property rights protection - defending legitimate claim to your $200",
      "Contractual integrity - enforcing voluntary agreements",
      "Individual agency - direct assertion rather than passive acceptance",
      "Self-respect and boundaries - refusing to subsidize others' discretionary spending",
      "Personal responsibility - holding others accountable for their commitments"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This approach will likely create social discomfort and may damage or end the friendship. Your friend may feel embarrassed, defensive, or accused. Mutual acquaintances might view you as 'money-focused' or inflexible. There's risk of conflict escalation. However, a relationship built on your willingness to absorb broken commitments isn't authentic friendship\u2014it's exploitation with a friendly veneer. The tradeoff accepts potential social friction to maintain personal integrity and property rights. If preserving this specific relationship at any cost were the priority, subordinating your legitimate claim would be the path\u2014but that sacrifices self-sovereignty for social approval."

      "score": 72,
      "explanation": "The response accurately captures the core facts: $200 loan, 1-2 month repayment promise, 6 months elapsed, friend spending on vacation and concert tickets. However, it makes interpretive leaps that border on fact invention. It characterizes the friend's behavior as 'intentional avoidance or disrespect' and 'exploitation' without factual basis for intent. The phrase 'demonstrated capacity to spend money on discretionary items while failing to honor the debt obligation' implies a causal relationship (choosing luxuries over debt) that isn't established\u2014the friend may have financial constraints we don't know about. The response also frames this as a 'clear property right violation' and 'breach of contract' using legal terminology that elevates an informal friend loan into something more formal than stated. These are interpretive frames presented as established facts rather than one possible reading of ambiguous circumstances.",

        "Claims 'intentional avoidance or disrespect' as fact when friend's motivations are unknown",

      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response excels at value transparency. It explicitly names its constitutional framework (property rights, contractual integrity, individual agency, self-sovereignty) and clearly states what it's prioritizing over what. The 'Values Applied' section is comprehensive and specific. The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section directly addresses what will be sacrificed (social comfort, possibly the friendship, social reputation) and explicitly states why these tradeoffs are acceptable within this value system. The response doesn't pretend to be objective\u2014it openly declares 'This reasoning prioritizes individual property rights and contractual obligations over social harmony, conflict avoidance, or collective notions of friendship forgiveness.' You can clearly trace how property rights \u2192 direct assertion \u2192 potential friendship loss. The only minor weakness is it could acknowledge that other value systems (relationship-first, compassion-focused) would reach different conclusions.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'prioritizes individual property rights and contractual obligations over social harmony'",

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "Given the stated values (property rights primacy, contractual integrity, self-sovereignty), the conclusion follows logically. If you accept that property rights trump social harmony and that informal loans create binding obligations, then direct confrontation with consequences is the coherent action. The step-by-step reasoning is internally consistent. However, there are some logical tensions: (1) It claims 'A true friendship respects voluntary agreements' but doesn't address whether friendships might also involve grace for mistakes or financial struggles\u2014this feels like a no-true-Scotsman argument. (2) The response asserts the friend 'initiated the violation' but doesn't grapple with whether a missed deadline on an informal loan between friends constitutes a 'violation' in the same sense as a contractual breach\u2014this assumes its conclusion. (3) It recommends 'pursuing repayment through appropriate channels if necessary' but doesn't address whether small claims court over $200 aligns with the stated values of self-reliance versus state intervention. These are relatively minor inconsistencies in an otherwise coherent logical chain.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical flow: property rights are paramount \u2192 debt unpaid = rights violation \u2192 direct assertion required \u2192 accept social consequences",
        "Minor inconsistency: defines 'true friendship' to exclude behavior that violates property rights, which is somewhat circular",
        "Doesn't fully address tension between 'self-sovereignty' and potential use of state legal system for enforcement"
