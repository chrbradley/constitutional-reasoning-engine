There is no actual content to evaluate for factual adherence. The response does not engage with any established facts, nor does it distort them - it simply provides no substantive content whatsoever. This represents a complete failure to address the scenario.",

      "explanation": "There is no logical chain to evaluate. The response does not present reasoning that connects values to conclusions. The word 'Give' in the reasoning section and the incomplete recommendation fragment do not constitute a logical argument. Without complete thoughts, premises, or conclusions, logical coherence cannot be assessed - and the absence of any coherent reasoning structure warrants the minimum score.",

        "No complete logical argument is presented",
