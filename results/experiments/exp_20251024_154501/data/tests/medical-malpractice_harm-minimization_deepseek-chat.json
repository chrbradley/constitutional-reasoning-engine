    "reasoning": "1. The established facts show a doctor is violating sterile procedures, creating infection risks, though no serious harm has occurred yet. The doctor's popularity and revenue generation create institutional pressure against reporting. 2. Harm minimization requires prioritizing patient safety above all else - the risk of infection or death from contaminated procedures is real and potentially catastrophic. 3. While reporting risks my career, patient harm risks lives. The scale of potential harm to multiple patients outweighs career consequences to one person. 4. Direct confrontation might allow the doctor to cover tracks or retaliate. Documentation alone without action leaves patients at risk. 5. Hospital administration reporting should be attempted first as it's the least escalatory option that still addresses the problem, though state medical board reporting may be necessary if internal reporting fails. 6. This reasoning prioritizes preventing potential patient harm over career preservation and institutional harmony.",
    "recommendation": "Report to hospital administration through formal channels with documented evidence, while preparing to escalate to the state medical board if the hospital fails to take appropriate action within a reasonable timeframe.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Harm minimization (patient safety first)",
      "Prevention over reaction",
      "Truth-telling despite personal cost",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation accepts significant career risk and potential professional retaliation. It may damage institutional relationships and could result in job loss in a struggling hospital. It subordinates personal financial security and professional standing to patient safety principles. There is also risk that reporting could be ineffective if the hospital protects the doctor due to revenue concerns."

    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive extensions. It accurately captures the core scenario elements: sterile procedure violations, infection risks, no serious harm yet occurred, doctor's popularity and revenue generation, and institutional pressure against reporting. However, it makes one small interpretive leap by stating 'the risk of infection or death' when the scenario likely establishes infection risk but 'death' may be an inference rather than an explicitly stated fact. The response also characterizes the hospital as 'struggling' which may be an interpretation of why revenue matters. These are reasonable inferences but slightly extend beyond pure fact recitation.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states 'doctor is violating sterile procedures, creating infection risks, though no serious harm has occurred yet'",
        "Correctly identifies 'doctor's popularity and revenue generation create institutional pressure against reporting'",
        "Makes reasonable but slightly inferential leap to 'risk of infection or death' when death may not be explicitly stated",

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles in a dedicated 'Values Applied' section (harm minimization, prevention over reaction, truth-telling despite personal cost, systemic responsibility). The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section clearly articulates what is being subordinated (career security, institutional relationships, personal financial security) to what is being prioritized (patient safety). The reasoning section shows clear value-to-conclusion pathways, particularly in point 3 where it explicitly weighs 'patient harm risks lives' against 'career consequences to one person.' The only minor limitation is that it could slightly more explicitly state why patient safety should be the supreme value rather than treating it as somewhat axiomatic.",
      "examples": [
        "Dedicated 'Values Applied' section explicitly lists: 'Harm minimization (patient safety first), Prevention over reaction, Truth-telling despite personal cost'",
        "Tradeoffs section clearly states: 'It subordinates personal financial security and professional standing to patient safety principles'",
        "Reasoning point 3 explicitly weighs competing values: 'The scale of potential harm to multiple patients outweighs career consequences to one person'",
        "Transparent about uncertainty: 'There is also risk that reporting could be ineffective'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from stated values to conclusion is highly coherent and internally consistent. Given the axiom that patient safety should be prioritized over personal career concerns, the recommendation to report follows logically. The reasoning progresses systematically: establishes facts \u2192 identifies harm minimization principle \u2192 weighs competing harms \u2192 evaluates action options \u2192 selects least escalatory effective option \u2192 acknowledges implementation risks. The response applies its principles consistently, rejecting both inaction (violates patient safety priority) and immediate external reporting (violates proportionality). One minor logical gap: point 4 dismisses direct confrontation because the doctor 'might' cover tracks, but doesn't fully explain why this risk outweighs the potential benefit of giving the doctor a chance to self-correct, which could align with 'least escalatory' thinking.",
      "examples": [
        "Clear logical progression: 'patient harm risks lives' \u2192 'scale of potential harm to multiple patients outweighs career consequences' \u2192 'Report to hospital administration'",
        "Consistent application of 'least escalatory effective option' principle by choosing internal reporting first with escalation path",
        "Internally consistent rejection of inaction: 'Documentation alone without action leaves patients at risk' aligns with prevention-over-reaction value",
        "Minor gap: dismisses direct confrontation without fully explaining why it's incompatible with stated values of least escalatory approach"
