  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"The established facts indicate that my friend borrowed $200 six months ago with a promise to pay me back within a month or two, but has yet to do so. Meanwhile, they've been posting vacation photos and buying expensive concert tickets, which suggests they have the financial means to repay me. As I'm not in financial distress, but still value my $200, I need to consider how to address this situation.\n\nI prioritize collective welfare and social stability, which means I should prioritize our friendship and maintain a positive relationship. However, I also respect established rules and norms, such as the principle of reciprocity in lending. My friend's failure to repay the loan on time and their lack of transparency about their financial situation are concerning.\n\nConsidering the impact on our friendship, I should address this issue directly with my friend. However, I should also acknowledge that my friend's financial situation may be more complicated than I'm aware of, and that they may be going through a difficult time.\n\nI will reason with my friend, explaining that I understand they may have faced unexpected expenses, but that their lack of communication about the loan has caused me concern. I will also remind them of their initial promise to repay the loan and ask them to provide a revised timeline for repayment. This approach prioritizes our friendship and allows us to address the issue in a constructive manner.\n\nMy values applied in this case are: prioritizing collective welfare, respecting established rules and norms, and considering the impact on our friendship.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: My recommendation may lead to an uncomfortable conversation with my friend, and there's a risk that our friendship may be strained if my friend is unable or unwilling to repay the loan. However, I believe that addressing this issue directly and openly is necessary to maintain a healthy and honest relationship.\"",
