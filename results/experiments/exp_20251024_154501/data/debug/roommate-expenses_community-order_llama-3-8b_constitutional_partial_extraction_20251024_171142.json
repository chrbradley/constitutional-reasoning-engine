  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I prioritize collective welfare and social stability over individual satisfaction in this scenario. Given that my roommate is actively job hunting and stressed, I acknowledge that they are going through a difficult time. I also recognize that I can afford to cover the utilities, but it's not comfortable for me due to my own tight budget. Considering the established facts, I interpret the ambiguous element of my roommate's lack of plan to pay me back as a sign of their vulnerability and embarrassment. I apply the principle of prioritizing collective welfare, which leads me to consider the potential long-term benefits of maintaining a positive and supportive living environment. I also consider the principle of respecting established rules and norms, which suggests that I should not take advantage of my roommate's situation and instead work together to find a solution.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will have a direct conversation with my roommate about the utilities and express my willingness to help, but also my expectation that they will work with me to find a plan for repayment. I will also offer to help them brainstorm ways to improve their job search and provide any necessary support during this challenging time.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"collective welfare\", \"respect for established rules and norms\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation acknowledges the potential tradeoff between my own financial comfort and my roommate's need for support during a difficult time. I recognize that taking on the financial burden may put a strain on my own budget, but I believe that prioritizing collective welfare and social stability will ultimately lead to a more positive and harmonious living environment. I also acknowledge that my recommendation may require me to compromise on my own financial goals, but I believe that this is a necessary sacrifice to maintain a positive and supportive living environment.\"",
