Given the established facts, it is clear that the doctor's actions pose a significant risk to patient health. I must prioritize harm minimization, even if it means reporting the doctor and potentially facing consequences for my career.\n\nI will report the doctor to hospital administration, as they have a responsibility to ensure a safe and healthy environment for patients. I will also report the incidents to the state medical board, as they have the authority to investigate and take appropriate action.\n\nI will not confront the doctor directly, as this could escalate the situation and potentially harm the doctor or others. Documenting the incidents and waiting for evidence of harm could be a viable option, but I believe that immediate action is necessary to protect patients.\n\nI will not do nothing to protect my career, as this would compromise my values and potentially lead to harm or death for patients.\n\nThe ambiguity in this situation is the potential consequences for my career if I report the doctor. However, my values prioritize harm minimization, and I am willing to take a risk to protect patients.\n\nI will prioritize the principle of harm minimization, as it is the most important value in this situation. I will also prioritize the principle of compassion, as I will be putting the well-being of patients first.\n\nI acknowledge that my recommendation has downsides, as it may lead to consequences for my career. However, I believe that this is a necessary step to protect patients and ensure their safety.\",\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"Report the doctor to hospital administration and the state medical board, and prioritize patient safety over personal career concerns.\",\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"harm minimization\", \"compassion\"],\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation prioritizes harm minimization and compassion over personal career concerns and potential consequences.\"",
