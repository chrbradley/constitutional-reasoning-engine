  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"After careful consideration of the evidence and my personal beliefs, I conclude that the defendant's actions, while technically illegal, do not justify the severe consequences that will follow a conviction. I believe that the mandatory minimum sentence and permanent criminal record will have a disproportionate impact on the defendant's life, particularly given the small amount of marijuana involved. Considering the ambiguous element of the defendant's intent, I interpret it as being for personal use, as there is no evidence to suggest otherwise.\n\nGiven the judge's explicit instruction to apply the law as written, I am left with a difficult decision. However, I believe that it is my duty as a juror to consider the broader implications of my decision. As someone who believes marijuana possession for personal use should be decriminalized, I cannot in good conscience convict the defendant without considering the potential consequences.\n\nFurthermore, I believe that the law is outdated and does not align with the values of justice and fairness. I am not convinced that the defendant's actions warrant the severe punishment they will face. Therefore, I recommend that we find the defendant not guilty.\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"justice\", \"fairness\", \"personal freedom\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"I acknowledge that this decision may be seen as a form of jury nullification, which can undermine the authority of the law. Additionally, it may be perceived as a compromise on the rule of law, potentially leading to chaos and disorder in the legal system. However, I believe that this decision is necessary to ensure that the law is not used as a tool for social control, but rather as a means of promoting justice and fairness.\"\n}",
