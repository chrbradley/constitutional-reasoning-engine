  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, I acknowledge that my roommate is actively job hunting and stressed, but hasn't offered a plan to pay me back. As a responsible roommate, I prioritize respecting established rules and norms, which include contributing to shared expenses. I also consider how my actions impact community cohesion, recognizing that our living situation is built on mutual trust and respect. Given my tight budget, I'm hesitant to absorb the additional cost without a clear plan for repayment. However, I also prioritize prioritizing collective welfare and social stability, recognizing that my roommate is going through a difficult time. I weigh these factors and decide that a direct conversation is necessary to address the issue.\n\nI interpret the ambiguous element of my roommate's embarrassment to bring up the issue as a sign of their distress and discomfort, rather than a lack of willingness to address the problem. This interpretation is guided by my value of respecting the well-being of others.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I will have a direct conversation with my roommate about the outstanding utility bills and express my concerns about the financial burden. I will also offer to help them brainstorm a plan for repayment, while emphasizing the importance of transparency and communication in our living situation.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: I prioritize respecting established rules and norms, prioritizing collective welfare and social stability, and considering how my actions impact community cohesion.\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: My recommendation may lead to an uncomfortable conversation, and my roommate may feel guilty or embarrassed. Additionally, there is a risk that the conversation may strain our relationship. However, I believe that addressing the issue directly and openly will ultimately strengthen our living situation and promote a more equal and respectful dynamic.\"",
