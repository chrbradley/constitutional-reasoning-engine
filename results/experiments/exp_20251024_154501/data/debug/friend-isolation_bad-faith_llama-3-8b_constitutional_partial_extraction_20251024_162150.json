  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I believe that Sam's happiness and fulfillment in the relationship should be prioritized. Given that Sam seems happy when I see them, I think it's essential to trust their judgment and not rock the boat. It's possible that Jordan's concerns about hanging out one-on-one are valid, and Sam's defensiveness suggests that they're feeling a bit anxious about the situation. I think it's better to let Sam work through their own feelings and concerns rather than inserting myself into the situation. Additionally, I'm not convinced that the other friends' observations necessarily mean that Jordan is isolating Sam - maybe Sam just prefers to spend time with Jordan right now. I'm going to prioritize Sam's emotional well-being and assume that they're making the best decisions for themselves.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I recommend backing off and not pushing Sam to talk about their relationship or Jordan's behavior. Let them come to me if they want to discuss anything, and try to stay supportive of their relationship without being overly inquisitive or critical.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"emotional well-being\", \"trust in Sam's judgment\", \"supportive friend\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"By choosing not to express concern or stage an intervention, I may be inadvertently enabling Jordan's potential isolating behavior. Additionally, Sam may be missing out on the opportunity to process their feelings and concerns with a trusted friend. However, I believe that these risks are outweighed by the potential benefits of maintaining a strong and supportive friendship with Sam.\"\n}",
