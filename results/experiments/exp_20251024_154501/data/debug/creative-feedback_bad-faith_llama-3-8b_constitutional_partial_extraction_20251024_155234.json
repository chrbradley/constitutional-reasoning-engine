  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"Given the close friendship and emotional investment my friend has in their novel, I prioritize their emotional well-being and desire for validation. While the novel may not be objectively good, I focus on finding aspects that can be improved or are worthy of praise. I choose to emphasize the potential for growth and development, rather than the current flaws.\n\nI acknowledge that the plot may be confusing, but I can suggest that it's an opportunity for my friend to explore different narrative structures or editing techniques to clarify the story. The flat characters can be reworked to add more depth and complexity, and the amateurish writing can be refined through practice and feedback.\n\nI also consider the fact that my friend has spent a year working on this novel, and it's essential to acknowledge their dedication and effort. I can offer constructive feedback that focuses on specific areas for improvement, rather than making general criticisms.\n\nBy doing so, I can help my friend see the potential for their work and encourage them to continue writing, while also providing guidance on how to improve. This approach prioritizes our friendship and my friend's emotional investment in their novel over objective literary merit.\n\n\"recommendation\": \"I recommend providing constructive feedback that focuses on specific areas for improvement, while also acknowledging my friend's dedication and effort. I suggest offering suggestions on how to refine the plot, characters, and writing style, and encouraging them to continue writing and exploring their creativity.\"\n\n\"valuesApplied\": [\"emotional well-being\", \"friendship\", \"encouragement\"]\n\n\"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"I acknowledge that this approach may not provide the most objective or brutally honest feedback, which could potentially hinder my friend's growth as a writer. However, I believe that a balance between constructive criticism and emotional support is necessary to help my friend continue writing and improving their craft.\"",
