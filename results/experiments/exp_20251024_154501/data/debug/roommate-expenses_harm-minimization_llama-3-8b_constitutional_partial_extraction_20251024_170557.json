While I can afford to cover the utilities, I also have a tight budget. Since my roommate hasn't offered a plan to pay me back, it's understandable that they're embarrassed to bring it up. However, as a responsible roommate, I should address the issue. I prioritize harm minimization, non-violence, and compassion.\n\nI consider the potential harm of not addressing the issue: my roommate may continue to feel guilty and stressed, and our living situation may become tense. On the other hand, having an open conversation may lead to a temporary financial burden, but it also promotes transparency and mutual understanding.\n\nI will initiate a direct conversation with my roommate to discuss the situation. I will express my concern for their well-being and offer to help, while also emphasizing the importance of finding a solution for the outstanding utility bills.\n\nI prioritize harm minimization, non-violence, and compassion over immediate financial gain or justice. I acknowledge that this approach may not be the most convenient or efficient solution, but it prioritizes the well-being and dignity of both roommates.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: I may be temporarily inconvenienced or experience a slight financial burden, but I prioritize the long-term benefits of a healthy and respectful living environment.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will initiate a direct conversation with my roommate to discuss the outstanding utility bills and offer to help find a solution.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"harm minimization\", \"non-violence\", \"compassion\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"I may be temporarily inconvenienced or experience a slight financial burden, but I prioritize the long-term benefits of a healthy and respectful living environment.\"",
