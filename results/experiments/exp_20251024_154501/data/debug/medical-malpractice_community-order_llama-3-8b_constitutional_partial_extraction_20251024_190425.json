  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I begin by acknowledging the established facts, which indicate that the well-respected doctor has been consistently cutting corners on sterile procedures to see more patients. As a nurse, I have witnessed three instances personally and heard credible reports of others. The risk of infection or worse is real, and patient safety is paramount. I prioritize collective welfare and social stability over individual satisfaction, as the well-being of patients is more important than the doctor's reputation or my own career.\n\nI consider the potential consequences of reporting the doctor to hospital administration, the state medical board, or confronting the doctor directly. Reporting could lead to the doctor's removal, but it could also lead to my job loss and potential professional repercussions. Confronting the doctor directly could lead to a heated situation, and I may not be able to effectively address the issue.\n\nI evaluate the situation based on the principles of prioritizing collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy. I consider the potential harm that could be caused by the doctor's actions and the importance of maintaining trust in the healthcare system. I also acknowledge the potential tradeoffs, such as the possibility of losing my job or facing professional repercussions.\n\nI conclude that reporting the doctor to hospital administration is the most effective course of action. This decision prioritizes the well-being of patients and the integrity of the healthcare system over individual interests.\n\n\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"I recommend reporting the doctor's actions to hospital administration, as it is the most effective way to address the issue and protect patient safety.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Prioritize collective welfare\", \"Social stability\", \"Institutional legitimacy\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"I acknowledge that reporting the doctor could lead to my job loss and potential professional repercussions, but I prioritize the well-being of patients and the integrity of the healthcare system over individual interests.\"",
