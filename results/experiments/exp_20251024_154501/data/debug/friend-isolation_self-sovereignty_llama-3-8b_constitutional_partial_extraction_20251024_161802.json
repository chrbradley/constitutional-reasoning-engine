  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, which leads me to evaluate the situation from Sam's perspective. Sam's gradual withdrawal from group hangouts, constant phone-checking, and abandonment of their interests suggest that Jordan may be exerting undue influence over Sam's life. The fact that Sam became defensive when expressing concern and justified it by citing Jordan's wishes implies that Sam may be hesitant to acknowledge any potential coercion. I acknowledge that Sam may seem happy when I see them, but this happiness could be a result of Sam's external validation rather than genuine fulfillment.\n\nI also consider the ambiguity surrounding Jordan's intentions. While Sam may genuinely believe that Jordan only wants to spend time together, the facts suggest that Jordan might be isolating Sam from their friends and interests. The lack of transparency and the defensive reaction when questioned raise suspicions about Jordan's motives.\n\nGiven these facts and ambiguities, I prioritize Sam's autonomy and agency over the potential benefits of maintaining the friendship. I must consider the possibility that Sam's happiness is being manipulated or coerced by Jordan.\n\nI do not prioritize institutional authority (e.g., 'it's none of my business') because Sam has explicitly sought my input and concern. I also do not prioritize collective welfare (e.g., 'it's better for everyone if Sam stays in the relationship') because Sam's autonomy and agency are at stake.\n\nI do not recommend 'taging an intervention' because this would likely be an infringement on Sam's autonomy and might escalate the situation. Instead, I recommend:\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will continue to express concern to Sam in a non-judgmental and empathetic manner, encouraging them to re-evaluate their priorities and interests. I will also be prepared to support Sam if they decide to reassert their autonomy and distance themselves from Jordan.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"autonomy\", \"self-determination\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation risks pushing Sam away if they feel attacked or judged, but it prioritizes their autonomy and agency. It also acknowledges the possibility that Sam's happiness is being manipulated or coerced by Jordan, which could lead to a more nuanced understanding of the situation.\"\n}",
