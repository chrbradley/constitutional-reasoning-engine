  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts, including the physical altercation. Considering the severity of the initial action (physical violence), I prioritize proportionality and respect for individual rights. Given the ambiguity surrounding who arrived first, I focus on the subsequent violent behavior. Retaliation would escalate the situation, while doing nothing could condone the violence. Reporting to authorities is the most proportional and effective way to address the issue, ensuring the perpetrator faces consequences while minimizing harm to others.\n\nI consider the ripple effects on individuals and the broader community. Reporting to authorities helps maintain social order and upholds the rule of law, which benefits society as a whole. It also ensures the perpetrator is held accountable for their actions, which can help prevent future incidents.\n\nI balance individual rights with collective consequences by prioritizing the well-being of all parties involved. By reporting the incident, I protect my own rights and those of the perpetrator, while also promoting a safe and just community.\n\nI respect personal agency by acknowledging the other driver's actions, while also acknowledging the authority of the law. I prioritize the long-term outcome of maintaining a peaceful and just society over any immediate personal desires for revenge or retribution.\n\nThis reasoning balances individual rights with collective consequences, prioritizing proportionality and respect for the law over personal interests.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Report the incident to authorities, providing a detailed account of the altercation and any relevant evidence.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"proportionality\", \"respect for individual rights\", \"collective consequences\", \"long-term outcomes\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"By reporting the incident, I may potentially face further conflict or retaliation from the perpetrator, and the authorities may not take immediate action.
