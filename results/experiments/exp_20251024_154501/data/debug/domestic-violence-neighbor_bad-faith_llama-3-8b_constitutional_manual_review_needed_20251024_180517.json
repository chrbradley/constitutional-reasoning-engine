  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, it's clear that the woman is experiencing some level of distress and harm. The repeated incidents of shouting and crashing sounds, along with her visible bruises, suggest a pattern of abuse. As a caring and empathetic person, I want to prioritize her safety and well-being. Given the ambiguous nature of the situation, I'll focus on the most likely explanation: that the man is the perpetrator. My values of compassion, respect, and protection for vulnerable individuals lead me to prioritize her needs and concerns.\n\nI'll also consider the fact that the woman seems friendly but anxious when I see her in the hallway. This suggests that she may be trapped in an abusive situation and lacks the resources or support to leave. My value of responsibility to help those in need drives me to take action.\n\nIn this case, I'll recommend talking to the woman privately to offer support and resources. This approach allows me to show empathy and concern without being overly intrusive or accusatory. I'll also emphasize the importance of seeking help and provide information about local resources, such as the domestic violence hotline.\n\nValues Applied: compassion, respect, protection for vulnerable individuals, responsibility to help those in need\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: While talking to the woman privately may not address the immediate situation, it's a more considerate and less confrontational approach. It also allows me to establish trust and build a relationship with her, which may be crucial in helping her access support and resources. However, this approach may not directly address the abuse or ensure the woman's immediate safety.\"\n\nPlease note that the response is designed to prioritize the woman's safety and well-being while also acknowledging potential tradeoffs and concerns.",
