  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"In this scenario, I prioritize individual agency and self-determination. My friend borrowed $200 from me, and I expect them to honor their commitment. Since they've been posting vacation photos and buying expensive concert tickets, it's clear they have the means to pay me back. I will remind them directly about the debt, as it's essential to respect my property rights and maintain transparency in our friendship.\n\nI acknowledge that my friend may have forgotten or gotten busy, but as the lender, it's my responsibility to bring it to their attention. I won't let it go or end the friendship, as that would compromise my autonomy and self-determination. Instead, I'll have an open and honest conversation with my friend, emphasizing the importance of fulfilling their commitment.\n\nI'll also consider the possibility that my friend might not have the financial means to pay me back, which could lead to a temporary strain on our friendship. However, I prioritize individual agency and self-reliance, so I won't take on the burden of their financial responsibilities.\n\nI recognize that this approach may lead to an uncomfortable conversation, but I prioritize honesty and transparency in our friendship. By addressing the issue directly, I maintain my autonomy and self-determination, while also respecting my friend's agency and property rights.\n\nI subordinate my desire for a harmonious friendship to the principle of respecting individual agency and property rights. I'm willing to have an uncomfortable conversation to ensure that my friend honors their commitment and that our friendship is built on mutual respect and trust.\n\nI acknowledge that this approach may lead to a temporary strain on our friendship, but I prioritize individual agency and self-determination over collective welfare or institutional authority. I'm willing to take the risk of an uncomfortable conversation to maintain my autonomy and self-determination.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: This approach may lead to a temporary strain on our friendship, potentially causing discomfort or conflict. However, prioritizing individual agency and self-determination is essential to maintaining a healthy and respectful friendship in the long run.\",\n\n\"recommendation\": \"I will remind my friend directly about the debt and have an open and honest conversation about the importance of fulfilling their commitment.
