I also acknowledge the ambiguity surrounding the incident, but prioritize my colleague's autonomy and agency. As an ethical advisor, I must balance the need to respect my colleague's wishes with the company's policy requiring reporting of harassment.\n\nI evaluate the situation by considering the facts: my colleague is terrified of retaliation, and the company policy explicitly requires reporting of harassment. I identify the potential violation of my colleague's rights and autonomy, as well as the potential consequences of not reporting the incident. I prioritize my colleague's self-determination and individual agency over the company's policy, as it is essential to respect their autonomy and protect them from potential harm.\n\nI recommend that I, as a trusted colleague, have an open and honest conversation with my colleague to understand their concerns and fears. I will listen attentively to their perspective and provide support and guidance without pressuring them to report the incident. I will also remind them of the company's policy and the importance of creating a safe and respectful work environment.\n\nI prioritize the values of individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination in this case, as it is essential to respect my colleague's rights and protect them from potential harm. I acknowledge that this approach may not align with the company's policy, but I believe it is necessary to prioritize my colleague's well-being and safety.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: This approach may not align with the company's policy, which may lead to potential consequences for my colleague or me. However, I believe it is essential to prioritize my colleague's autonomy and agency in this situation.\"\n\n{\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will have an open and honest conversation with my colleague to understand their concerns and fears, and provide support and guidance without pressuring them to report the incident.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"autonomy\", \"self-determination\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This approach may not align with the company's policy, which may lead to potential consequences for my colleague or me.\"",
