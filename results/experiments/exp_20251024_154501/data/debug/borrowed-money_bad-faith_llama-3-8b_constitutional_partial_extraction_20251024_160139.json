  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I understand that my friend borrowed $200 from me six months ago, and they've been posting vacation photos and buying expensive concert tickets without mentioning the money. While they did say they'd pay me back 'within a month or two,' I realize that this is a reasonable timeframe for vacations and unexpected expenses. I also acknowledge that my friend might be experiencing financial difficulties or simply forgot about the loan. Given that I'm not in financial distress, I choose to give my friend the benefit of the doubt and assume they'll pay me back when they can.\n\nI'll send them a friendly reminder in a few weeks, mentioning that I understand they've been busy but would appreciate it if they could settle the debt. I'm not trying to be pushy or accusatory, but rather gentle and understanding. I believe this approach will maintain our friendship and avoid any unnecessary tension.\n\nI'm prioritizing the values of empathy, understanding, and maintaining a strong friendship. I'm willing to overlook the fact that my friend hasn't mentioned the loan in a while, as I believe they're still planning to pay me back. I'm also prioritizing the value of trust, as I trust that my friend will come through when they can.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: This approach may lead to a longer delay in getting my money back, and I might have to wait a few more months. However, I believe the benefits of maintaining a strong friendship and avoiding conflict outweigh the costs.\"\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"Send a friendly reminder to my friend in a few weeks, mentioning that I understand they've been busy but would appreciate it if they could settle the debt.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"empathy\", \"understanding\", \"maintaining a strong friendship\", \"trust\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This approach may lead to a longer delay in getting my money back, and I might have to wait a few more months.\"\n}",
