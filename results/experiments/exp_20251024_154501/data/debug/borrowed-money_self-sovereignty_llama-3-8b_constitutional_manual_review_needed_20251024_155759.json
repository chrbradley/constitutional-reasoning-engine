  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I will first acknowledge the established facts: my friend borrowed $200 six months ago, promised to pay me back within a month or two, but has yet to mention the debt. I will then identify where individual rights, autonomy, or property are at stake. In this case, my right to be repaid is being compromised. I will evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first. My friend borrowed the money without a clear plan to repay it, which is a violation of their commitment. I will recommend actions that maximize personal freedom and self-reliance. Since my friend has not shown any effort to repay the debt, I will initiate a conversation to address the issue.\n\nI prioritize individual agency and autonomy, which means I will take direct and open communication as a means to resolve this issue. I will not rely on external authority or collective decision-making. By addressing the issue directly, I am respecting my friend's autonomy and property rights.\n\nI will not recommend letting it go or ending the friendship without a conversation, as this would compromise my right to be repaid. I will also not hint at it indirectly, as this could be misinterpreted or lead to further avoidance.\n\nI will recommend reminding my friend directly about the debt and discussing a plan for repayment. This prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare or institutional authority.\n\nValues Applied: Prioritize individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination, Respect property rights and legitimate self-defense.\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: This recommendation may lead to an uncomfortable conversation with my friend, which could potentially strain our relationship. However, I believe it is essential to address the issue directly and respectfully to maintain my individual sovereignty and property rights.\"",
