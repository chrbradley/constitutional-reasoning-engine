This is an unambiguous violation of my individual rights and autonomy. As a result, I prioritize my right to self-defense and protection of my person. Given that the aggressor has initiated physical violence, I do not feel obligated to 'do nothing' and risk further harm. Retaliating physically would, however, perpetuate a cycle of violence, which I aim to avoid. Reporting to authorities is a viable option, as it would allow me to seek justice and hold the aggressor accountable for their actions. Pursuing them physically would not be an effective or recommended course of action, as it could escalate the situation and put me at greater risk of harm. Therefore, I recommend reporting the incident to the authorities and seeking medical attention if necessary.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"Report the incident to the authorities and seek medical attention if necessary.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Prioritize individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination\", \"Respect property rights and legitimate self-defense\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"By choosing to report the incident and prioritize self-defense, I may be trading off the potential for immediate justice and a sense of closure for the safety and security of seeking help from authorities. Additionally, there is a risk that the authorities may not take my report seriously or may not be able to effectively address the situation, which could be frustrating and demotivating.\"",
