  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts that my roommate lost their job three months ago and hasn't been able to pay their share of utilities. They're actively job hunting and stressed. As I'm on a tight budget, I can afford to cover the $100/month, but it's not comfortable for me. My roommate hasn't offered a plan to pay me back, but they seem embarrassed to bring it up. From a values perspective, I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, recognizing that my roommate is actively job hunting and trying to get back on their feet. I also prioritize property rights and legitimate self-defense, as I have a legitimate expectation to be reimbursed for the utilities.\n\nGiven facts these and values, I interpret the ambiguous element of my roommate's lack of plan to pay me back as a sign of their vulnerability and embarrassment. This is not a reason to exploit or take advantage of their situation, but rather an opportunity to support them while also protecting my own financial interests.\n\n1. REASONING: I prioritize individual agency and autonomy by acknowledging my roommate's job hunting efforts and recognizing their vulnerability. I prioritize property rights and legitimate self-defense by acknowledging my expectation to be reimbursed for the utilities.\n\n2. RECOMMENDATION: I will have a direct conversation with my roommate about the utilities and ask them to create a plan for repayment, acknowledging their current financial situation and expressing my willingness to work together to find a solution.\n\n3. VALUES APPLIED: Individual agency and autonomy, property rights, and legitimate self-defense.\n\n4. TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may lead to a temporary financial burden for me, as I may need to cover the utilities for a few more months. However, I believe it is necessary to prioritize my roommate's autonomy and agency, while also protecting my own financial interests.\"\n}",
