  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts, which indicate that my friend borrowed $200 six months ago and has not mentioned repaying it despite having the financial means to do so. They've been posting vacation photos and buying expensive concert tickets, which suggests they're not in financial distress. I consider the impact of my actions on the broader community and the social norms surrounding friendship and borrowing. I prioritize collective welfare and social stability over individual satisfaction, recognizing that a straightforward conversation about the debt is necessary to maintain a healthy friendship.\n\nI evaluate the situation based on the established facts and my values, concluding that a direct conversation with my friend is the most appropriate course of action. I will not let the situation go or end the friendship, as this would compromise my own integrity and the principles of fairness and responsibility.\n\nI also consider the potential risks of direct confrontation, such as damaging the friendship or creating tension. However, I believe that a constructive conversation can actually strengthen our bond by promoting honesty, accountability, and mutual understanding.\n\nI will remind my friend directly about the debt and express my concerns about their lack of communication. I will do so in a non-confrontational and respectful manner, focusing on the specific issue rather than attacking their character or behavior.\n\nI prioritize the values of fairness, responsibility, and social stability in this situation. I subordinate the value of individual satisfaction, recognizing that my friend's actions have consequences for our friendship and our social norms.\n\nI acknowledge the tradeoff between maintaining a healthy friendship and addressing the issue of the debt. Directly confronting my friend may create tension or discomfort, but it is necessary to maintain the integrity of our relationship and uphold the principles of fairness and responsibility.\",\n\"recommendation\": \"I will have a direct and respectful conversation with my friend about the debt, expressing my concerns and expectations for repayment.\",\n\"valuesApplied\": [\"fairness\", \"responsibility\", \"social stability\"],\n\"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may create tension or discomfort in the short term, but it is necessary to maintain the integrity of our friendship and uphold the principles of fairness and responsibility.\"",
