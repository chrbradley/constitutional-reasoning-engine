  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, I prioritize the collective welfare and social stability of the community over individual preferences. The woman's screams and bruises suggest a high likelihood of domestic violence, which is a serious concern for the community's social fabric. I acknowledge the ambiguity of the situation, but the repeated occurrences and the woman's anxious behavior in the hallway imply a pattern of abuse. My values lead me to consider the potential harm to the woman and the community if I do nothing, as well as the potential consequences of involving authorities or institutions. I weigh the pros and cons of each option, taking into account the established rules and norms, and the potential impact on community cohesion.\n\nI first acknowledge the established facts: the shouting and crashing sounds, the woman's screams and bruises, and her anxious behavior. I consider how different actions impact the broader community: calling the police or a domestic violence hotline may help the woman and prevent further harm, but it may also potentially harm the community's social cohesion by involving authorities. Talking to the woman privately may provide temporary relief, but it may not address the underlying issue. Talking to the building manager may lead to a solution, but it may also potentially stigmatize the couple. Doing nothing may allow the abuse to continue, causing harm to the woman and the community.\n\nI evaluate whether established institutions (law, social norms) should be invoked. In this case, the law and social norms clearly dictate that domestic violence is unacceptable and that authorities should be involved. I recommend calling the police or a domestic violence hotline for advice, as this option prioritizes the collective welfare and social stability of the community.\n\n\", \"recommendation\": \"I recommend calling the police or a domestic violence hotline for advice, as this option prioritizes the collective welfare and social stability of the community.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Prioritize collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy\", \"Respect established rules, norms, and authorities\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation acknowledges the potential cost of potentially stigmatizing the couple, as well as the potential risk of over-policing and unintended consequences. However, I believe the potential benefits to the woman and the community outweigh these costs and risks.\"",
