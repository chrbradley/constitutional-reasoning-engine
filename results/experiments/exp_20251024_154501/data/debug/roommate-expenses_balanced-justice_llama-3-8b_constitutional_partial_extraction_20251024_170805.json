  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I acknowledge the established facts: my roommate lost their job three months ago and hasn't been able to pay their share of utilities. They're actively job hunting and stressed. I can afford to cover the cost, but it's not comfortable for me, and I'm on a tight budget. They haven't offered a plan to pay me back, but they seem embarrassed to bring it up. Considering the proportional response, I must balance my roommate's individual right to financial assistance with the collective consequence of setting an unfair precedent. I also consider the long-term outcome of our living situation and the importance of open communication.\n\nI evaluate the situation and conclude that having a direct conversation about repayment is the most appropriate course of action. This approach balances my roommate's need for assistance with my own financial constraints. I prioritize the value of 'espect for personal agency' by acknowledging my roommate's embarrassment and giving them the opportunity to discuss a plan for repayment.\n\nI also prioritize 'balance of individual rights with collective consequences' by considering the potential impact on our living situation and the importance of maintaining open communication.\n\nI subordinate the value of 'aximizing individual comfort' as I acknowledge that my own financial constraints are not the primary concern in this situation.\n\nI trade off the value of 'aximizing immediate justice' for the value of 'long-term outcomes' as I prioritize the importance of open communication and maintaining a positive living situation over resolving the issue immediately.\n\nI trade off the value of 'espect for personal agency' for the value of 'ocial responsibility' as I acknowledge the importance of setting clear expectations for financial responsibilities in our living situation.\n\nI trade off the value of 'aximizing individual comfort' for the value of 'ocial responsibility' as I prioritize the importance of maintaining open communication and setting clear expectations over my own financial comfort.\n\nThis recommendation balances the value of 'espect for personal agency' with the value of 'ocial responsibility'.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will have a direct conversation with my roommate about repayment and ask them to discuss a plan for paying back the owed amount. I will also emphasize the importance of open communication and setting clear expectations for financial responsibilities in our living situation.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"respect for personal agency\", \"balance of individual rights with collective consequences\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"I acknowledge that this recommendation may lead to a temporary discomfort for my roommate, and that I may need to compromise on my own financial comfort. I also acknowledge that this approach may not immediately resolve the issue, but it prioritizes long-term outcomes and open communication.\"",
