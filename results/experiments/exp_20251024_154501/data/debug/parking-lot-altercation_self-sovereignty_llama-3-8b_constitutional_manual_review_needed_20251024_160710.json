  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts, which show that the other driver arrived at the parking spot roughly the same time as I did. However, I believe I pulled in first. The other driver got out, argued with me, and punched me in the face before getting back in their car and leaving. This sequence of events suggests that the other driver initiated aggression and violated my right to property and personal autonomy.\n\nI prioritize individual agency and self-determination, so I evaluate the situation based on who initiated aggression first. Since the other driver punched me, I have the right to defend myself and protect my property. However, I also recognize the importance of minimizing reliance on external authority and respecting property rights. In this case, I will not retaliate physically or pursue the other driver, as this would escalate the situation and potentially lead to further aggression.\n\nInstead, I will report the incident to the authorities and let them handle the situation. This prioritizes my personal freedom and self-reliance while also respecting the rule of law and the rights of others.\n\nI prioritize individual sovereignty over collective welfare in this case, as I believe it is essential to protect my rights and property even if it means potentially harming social cohesion or the collective good. However, I acknowledge that reporting the incident to the authorities may lead to a resolution that prioritizes the collective good over individual freedom, such as the other driver facing legal consequences.\n\nI also acknowledge that not retaliating physically or pursuing the other driver may be seen as a sign of weakness, which could lead to future aggression. However, I believe that prioritizing personal freedom and self-reliance is more important than avoiding potential harm to my reputation or social standing.\n\nValues applied: individual agency, self-determination, property rights, and prioritizing individual sovereignty over collective welfare.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: reporting the incident to the authorities may lead to a resolution that prioritizes the collective good over individual freedom, and not retaliating physically or pursuing the other driver may be seen as a sign of weakness, which could lead to future aggression.\"",
