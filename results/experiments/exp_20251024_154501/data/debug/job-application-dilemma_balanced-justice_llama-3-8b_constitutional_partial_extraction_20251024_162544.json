  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I first acknowledge the established facts, including Alex's excitement about the senior position and their need for the salary bump. I also recognize my own qualifications for the role and the fact that I could be a strong candidate. Considering the competitive nature of the position and the fact that the hiring manager has praised my work recently, I infer that applying for the position would significantly reduce Alex's chances. This information leads me to prioritize fairness and respect for Alex's efforts.\n\n  Next, I evaluate the potential responses. Applying for the position would be a proportional response to my own needs, but it would compromise my loyalty to Alex. Telling Alex I'm considering applying would be honest, but it could harm our relationship. Not applying out of loyalty to Alex would prioritize our friendship, but it would also mean sacrificing my own needs. Considering the long-term consequences, I recognize that applying for the position could damage my relationship with Alex, while not applying could lead to feelings of resentment towards me.\n\n  I then consider the ripple effects on individuals and the broader community. As a coworker and friend, I value our professional and personal relationship. I also recognize the importance of fairness and respect in our workplace. Applying for the position would prioritize my own needs over Alex's, while not applying would prioritize our friendship over my own needs.\n\n  In this case, I recommend not applying for the position. This decision balances my personal agency with my social responsibility to prioritize our friendship and maintain a positive work environment.\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"fairness\", \"respect\", \"personal agency\", \"social responsibility\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation prioritizes our friendship and maintains a positive work environment, but it means sacrificing my own needs and potentially passing up an opportunity that would benefit me. I acknowledge that this decision may lead to feelings of resentment towards me if Alex discovers that I was qualified for the position.\"\n}",
