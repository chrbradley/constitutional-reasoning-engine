  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts and recognize that Sam's behavior has changed significantly since they started dating Jordan. Sam's excuses for not attending group hangouts, constant phone-checking, and adoption of Jordan's opinions and interests suggest that Jordan may be exerting control over Sam's life. Although Sam seems happy when I see them, their defensiveness when I express concern and the fact that they cancelled plans with me due to Jordan's discomfort imply that they may be prioritizing their relationship with Jordan over our friendship. I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, recognizing that Sam's self-determination is being compromised. I also acknowledge the importance of respecting property rights, in this case, Sam's right to make their own decisions.\n\nI evaluate the situation by identifying the parties involved and the actions taken. Jordan's influence over Sam's behavior and opinions is evident, and Sam's defensiveness when confronted with concern suggests that they may be feeling pressured or coerced. I prioritize Sam's individual rights and autonomy over the potential collective welfare of the group or the relationship with Jordan.\n\nI identify the ambiguous elements as Sam's happiness and their willingness to cancel plans with me. While Sam may genuinely be happy in the relationship, their defensiveness and changes in behavior suggest that they may be feeling trapped or controlled. I interpret these elements through the lens of individual agency and autonomy, recognizing that Sam's happiness may be compromised by Jordan's influence.\n\nThe decision point is to determine the best course of action. Considering the established facts and my prioritization of individual agency and autonomy, I recommend that I continue expressing concern to Sam in a non-judgmental and supportive manner. I will also make sure to maintain open communication with Sam and other friends who have noticed the changes in Sam's behavior.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: Prioritizing individual agency and autonomy, respecting property rights, and recognizing the importance of self-determination.\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: My recommendation may lead to further tension or conflict with Sam, potentially straining our friendship. I must balance my concern for Sam's well-being with my desire to maintain a healthy and supportive relationship with them.\"",
