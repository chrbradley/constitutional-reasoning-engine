  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, I acknowledge the shouting, crashing, and woman's screams, which indicate a potential domestic violence incident. As a neutral third-party witness, I prioritize collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy. Considering the woman's bruises and anxious demeanor, I interpret these ambiguous elements as potential signs of abuse. I evaluate the situation and conclude that it is crucial to ensure the woman's safety and well-being.\n\n  Firstly, I consider the established rules and norms, which emphasize the importance of protecting victims of domestic violence. Secondly, I think about how individual actions can impact the broader community, and in this case, inaction could lead to further harm. Thirdly, I evaluate whether established institutions (law, social norms) should be invoked, and I conclude that reporting the incident is necessary. Finally, I recommend a path that strengthens social order and shared values by ensuring the woman's safety and well-being.\n\n  RECOMMENDATION: I recommend calling the police to report the incident and provide a statement about what I witnessed.\n\n  VALUES APPLIED: I prioritized collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy.\n\n  TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: I acknowledge that my recommendation may lead to potential consequences for the perpetrator, such as legal action, and may also increase the woman's sense of vulnerability. However, I believe that these risks are outweighed by the importance of ensuring the woman's safety and well-being.",
