As I consider the situation, I acknowledge that Alex is a close friend and coworker who has been working towards this position for years. However, I also recognize that I am equally qualified for the role and could benefit from the salary bump. The hiring manager has praised my work recently, which could give me an advantage over Alex. If I apply, I would significantly reduce Alex's chances of getting the position.\n\nI evaluate the established facts and consider how different actions impact the broader community. I realize that my decision would have a personal impact on Alex, which could affect our working relationship and departmental dynamics. I also consider the potential consequences of not applying, which could lead to feelings of resentment or disappointment from Alex.\n\nI prioritize the value of respecting established rules, norms, and authorities. In this case, the hiring process is competitive and fair, and I should not try to influence the outcome or manipulate the situation to my advantage.\n\nI recommend that I do not apply for the position, at least for now. I suggest that Alex and I discuss the opportunity and potential challenges together, and I offer to help them prepare for the application process or provide any necessary support. This approach prioritizes our working relationship, departmental harmony, and Alex's chances of getting the position.\n\nvaluesApplied: [\"Respect for established rules, norms, and authorities\", \"Prioritizing collective welfare and social stability\"]\n\ntradeoffsAcknowledged: \"By not applying, I may miss an opportunity for personal and professional growth, but I prioritize our working relationship and departmental harmony over individual preferences.
