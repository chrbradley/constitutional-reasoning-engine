  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I begin by acknowledging the established facts, including Sam's gradual disengagement from group hangouts, their adoption of Jordan's opinions and interests, and their defensive response when I expressed concern. I evaluate these facts through the lens of my core values, prioritizing balanced justice, respect for individual agency, and consideration of long-term outcomes.\n\nI interpret the ambiguous elements as follows: Sam's happiness when I see them, or at least their expressed happiness, suggests that they may not be fully aware of the impact Jordan is having on their life. The fact that other friends have noticed a change in Sam's behavior implies that this is not just a personal issue, but potentially a pattern of behavior that could have broader consequences.\n\nGiven these facts and interpretations, I believe it is important to continue expressing concern to Sam, while also respecting their agency and autonomy. However, I also recognize the risk of pushing Sam away, and thus I would recommend a nuanced approach.\n\nI would suggest having an open and honest conversation with Sam, expressing my concerns in a non-judgmental and empathetic manner. I would ask Sam to reflect on their feelings and experiences, and encourage them to consider the potential impact of Jordan's behavior on their relationships and overall well-being. I would also offer support and resources to help Sam navigate any challenges they may be facing.\n\nThis approach balances the value of individual agency with the importance of considering the potential consequences of Jordan's behavior. By respecting Sam's autonomy while also encouraging them to think critically about their situation, I believe we can find a solution that prioritizes both individual well-being and collective responsibility.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: individual agency, respect for collective responsibility, consideration of long-term outcomes\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may risk pushing Sam away or making them feel uncomfortable, which could have negative consequences for our friendship. However, I believe that it is important to prioritize the potential long-term consequences of Jordan's behavior and the potential impact on Sam's well-being, even if it means having a difficult conversation.\"",
