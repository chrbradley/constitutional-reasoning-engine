Considering the facts, I acknowledge that Alex is a close friend and coworker who has been working towards this opportunity for years. They genuinely need the salary bump due to financial struggles. I also recognize that I am qualified for the position and could benefit from the role. However, I evaluate the impact on the broader community and conclude that applying for the position would significantly reduce Alex's chances, as the hiring manager has praised my work recently. I prioritize the department's social stability and institutional legitimacy by respecting established norms and authorities. In this case, I interpret the ambiguous element of the competitive nature of the position as a challenge to uphold fairness and equity in the hiring process.\n\nI reason that applying for the position would compromise Alex's opportunities and potentially harm our working relationship. Instead, I recommend not applying for the position, prioritizing Alex's chances and our professional relationship over my individual interests.\n\n\"valuesApplied\": [\"Prioritize collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy\", \"Respect established rules, norms, and authorities\"],\n\n\"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"By not applying for the position, I acknowledge that I may miss an opportunity for personal growth and career advancement.
