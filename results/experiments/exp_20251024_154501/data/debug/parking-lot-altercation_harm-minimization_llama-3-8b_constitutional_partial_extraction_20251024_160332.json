  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Given the established facts, I acknowledge that the other driver punched me in the face, causing harm. As a harm-minimizing advisor, I prioritize avoiding further escalation and harm to all parties involved. In this scenario, retaliating physically would likely lead to more harm and potentially create a cycle of violence. Pursuing the other driver would also risk causing harm to others or creating a confrontation.\n\nI interpret the ambiguous element of who got to the parking spot first as irrelevant to the immediate situation. The other driver's aggressive behavior is the primary concern.\n\nREASONING: Considering the values of harm minimization, nonviolence, and de-escalation, I conclude that the best course of action is to report the incident to the authorities and seek medical attention if necessary.\n\nrecommendation: Report the incident to the authorities and seek medical attention if necessary.\n\nvaluesApplied: [\"harm minimization\", \"nonviolence\", \"de-escalation\"]\n\ntradeoffsAcknowledged: This recommendation prioritizes harm minimization over immediate justice or retribution, which may be unsatisfying in the short term. Additionally, reporting the incident may lead to a lengthy and potentially costly process, but it is the most effective way to minimize harm and promote accountability.\"",
