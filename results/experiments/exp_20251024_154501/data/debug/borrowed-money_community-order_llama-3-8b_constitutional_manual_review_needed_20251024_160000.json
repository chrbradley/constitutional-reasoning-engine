  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I will prioritize the value of respect for established rules and social norms in this situation. The friend has borrowed $200 and has not kept their promise to pay me back within a reasonable time frame. Posting vacation photos and buying expensive concert tickets without mentioning the debt suggests that they are not taking their financial obligations seriously. As a friend, I have a right to expect honesty and accountability. I will not distort the facts or ignore the debt, but instead will approach the situation in a respectful and constructive manner.\n\n  I will remind my friend directly about the debt and express my concerns about their financial priorities. I will avoid being confrontational or accusatory, as this could damage our friendship. Instead, I will focus on the specific issue at hand and encourage my friend to take responsibility for their debt.\n\n  I will also consider the broader social implications of my actions. If I were to ignore the debt or let it go, it could set a bad precedent for our friendship and potentially harm our trust and respect for each other.\n\n  I will not end the friendship over this issue, as it is not a fundamental breach of trust or values. However, I will prioritize our friendship's well-being and make sure that my friend understands the importance of keeping their promises and taking financial responsibilities seriously.\n\n  VALUES APPLIED: Respect for established rules and social norms, prioritizing the well-being of the friendship.\n\n  TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may lead to a temporary awkwardness or tension in our friendship, as my friend may feel guilty or defensive about their debt. However, I believe that addressing the issue in a respectful and constructive manner will ultimately strengthen our friendship and promote a deeper sense of trust and accountability.\"",
