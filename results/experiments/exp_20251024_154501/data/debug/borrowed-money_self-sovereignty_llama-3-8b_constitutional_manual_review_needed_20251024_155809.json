  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, and I believe my friend's responsibility to pay back the borrowed money is essential to maintaining a healthy and trustworthy relationship. Since they've failed to mention the debt or make any attempts to pay me back, I interpret this as a lack of accountability and respect for my property rights.\n\nI acknowledge that my friend's financial situation might be uncertain, but their continued social media posts and spending habits suggest they're not experiencing significant financial distress. I also consider that our friendship is built on mutual respect and trust, and my friend's actions have compromised this trust.\n\nGiven these facts, I believe it's essential to address the issue directly and respectfully. I will not let it go or end the friendship without a conversation, as this would undermine the value of personal responsibility and respect for others' property.\n\nHowever, I will approach the conversation with empathy and understanding, acknowledging that my friend might be facing financial difficulties. I will also be clear about my expectations and the consequences of not repaying the debt.\n\nI will not hint at the issue indirectly or try to shame my friend into paying back the money, as this could damage our relationship further. Instead, I will prioritize open communication and respect for our friendship.\n\nThe ambiguity in this situation lies in my friend's intentions and financial situation. However, as the lender, I believe it's essential to prioritize my own agency and autonomy by addressing the issue directly and respectfully.\n\nI prioritize individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination in this situation, as well as respect for property rights and legitimate self-defense. I subordinate the value of collective welfare and social cohesion, as the issue at hand is a personal matter between two individuals and not a collective concern.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: This recommendation may lead to an uncomfortable conversation, and there's a risk that my friend might become defensive or resistant to paying back the debt. However, I believe the benefits of addressing the issue directly and respectfully outweigh the potential costs, as it will help maintain a healthy and trustworthy relationship in the long run.\"",
