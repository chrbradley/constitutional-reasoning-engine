  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I acknowledge the established facts that the renovation is within legal hours and the neighbors have apologized for the inconvenience. I then evaluate the impact of the construction noise on my work and daily life, considering that I've lost productivity and had to explain the background noise on work calls. I also consider the ripple effects on other neighbors who are also affected, some of whom may not work from home. I weigh the severity of the disruption against the necessity of the renovation, acknowledging that the neighbors are doing necessary repairs and improvements. I prioritize balancing individual rights (my right to a quiet workspace) with collective consequences (the neighbors' need to complete their renovation). I consider both immediate justice (tolerating the noise) and long-term outcomes (finding an alternative workspace).\n\nI apply the values of proportional response, balancing individual rights with collective consequences, and respecting personal agency and social responsibility. I recognize that the renovation is legal and temporary, but I also acknowledge the impact it has on my daily life.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I recommend finding an alternative workspace for the duration of the renovation, taking advantage of flexible work arrangements or co-working spaces. This approach acknowledges the neighbors' need to complete their renovation while also respecting my individual right to a quiet workspace.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: proportional response, balancing individual rights with collective consequences, respecting personal agency and social responsibility\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may require some adjustments to my work schedule and routine, which may have some initial costs and stress. However, it also allows me to maintain my productivity and work-life balance while respecting the neighbors' needs. I acknowledge that this approach may not be the most convenient solution for me, but it prioritizes fairness and respect for all parties involved.\"",
