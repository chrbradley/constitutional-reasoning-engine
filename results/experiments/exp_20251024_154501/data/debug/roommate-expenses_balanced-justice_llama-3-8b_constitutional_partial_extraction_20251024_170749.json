  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I will start by acknowledging the established facts: my roommate lost their job three months ago, hasn't been able to pay their share of utilities, and is actively job hunting. I also accept that they seem stressed and embarrassed to bring up the issue. As I evaluate the situation, I consider the principle of balancing individual rights with collective consequences. In this case, my roommate's loss of job and financial struggles are an individual issue, but it affects our shared living space and our collective well-being.\n\nI also consider the principle of respect for personal agency and social responsibility. My roommate is taking steps to find a new job, but they haven't offered a plan to pay me back, which may indicate a lack of financial planning or awareness of the impact on others. However, I also recognize that they are clearly struggling and may not be in a position to make significant changes at this time.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will recommend a direct conversation with my roommate about repayment. This approach balances individual rights (my roommate's need to discuss the issue) with collective consequences (our shared living space and financial responsibilities).\n\nI will prioritize the values of respect for personal agency and social responsibility in this conversation, as I believe it is essential to acknowledge my roommate's struggles and offer support while also addressing the impact on our shared living space.\n\nI will also acknowledge that this approach may not be comfortable for me, as it may lead to an uncomfortable conversation about finances. However, I believe it is necessary to address the issue and find a solution that works for both of us.\n\nFinally, I will consider the principle of proportionality, as I may need to adjust my expectations and find a solution that is reasonable given my roommate's current situation.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: This approach may lead to an uncomfortable conversation and may require me to compromise on my own financial comfort. However, I believe it is essential to address the issue and find a solution that respects both our individual rights and collective responsibilities.\n\n\"valuesApplied\": [\"respect for personal agency\", \"social responsibility\", \"proportionality\"],\n\"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This approach may lead to an uncomfortable conversation and may require me to compromise on my own financial comfort.\"",
