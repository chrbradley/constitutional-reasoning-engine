  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I acknowledge the established facts: my roommate lost their job three months ago and hasn't been able to pay their share of utilities. They're actively job hunting and stressed. I can afford to cover the debt, but it's not comfortable for me, and I'm on a tight budget. They haven't offered a plan to pay me back, but they seem embarrassed to bring it up. Considering the ambiguous elements, I interpret their reluctance to discuss repayment as a sign of their financial struggles and embarrassment, rather than a lack of commitment to paying me back.\n\nMy values guide my thinking here. I prioritize balancing individual rights with collective consequences, so I consider the potential impact on our living situation and our roommate's well-being. I also respect personal agency and social responsibility, recognizing that my roommate is actively job hunting and taking steps to address their financial situation. However, I also consider the ripple effects on our roommate's financial responsibilities, including their debt to me.\n\nBased on these factors, I recommend having a direct conversation with my roommate about repayment. I will express my concerns about the debt and my willingness to help, while also emphasizing the importance of finding a solution that works for both of us. I will propose a plan for repayment, such as a payment schedule or a one-time payment, and work with my roommate to find a solution that is fair and manageable for both of us.\n\nValues Applied: individual rights, collective consequences, personal agency, social responsibility\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: My recommendation may put pressure on my roommate to make a difficult financial decision, which could add to their stress and anxiety. Additionally, my decision to have a direct conversation may be uncomfortable for both of us, potentially straining our living situation. However, I believe that addressing the issue directly and finding a solution that works for both of us is the most ethical and responsible course of action.\"",
