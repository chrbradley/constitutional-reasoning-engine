  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"In this scenario, I prioritize collective welfare and social stability, as well as respecting established rules and norms. My roommate's financial struggles are a clear stress factor, and covering the utilities would alleviate some of that burden. However, I also acknowledge that I'm on a tight budget and that covering the expenses without a plan for repayment could set a bad precedent. I consider the fact that my roommate is actively job hunting and seems embarrassed to bring up the issue. I prioritize fairness and transparency in our living arrangement, and I believe that having an open conversation about the situation would be the most beneficial for both of us.\n\nI evaluate the potential consequences of each option. Accepting the situation as it is without a plan for repayment could lead to resentment and tension in our living arrangement. Asking my roommate to move out might alleviate the financial burden but would also lead to an emotional and logistical challenge. Having a direct conversation about repayment could clear the air and establish a sense of mutual respect and understanding.\n\nIn this case, I prioritize fairness, transparency, and collective welfare. I believe that having a direct conversation about repayment is the most beneficial option, as it would allow us to address the issue directly and establish a plan for repayment that works for both of us.\n\nI acknowledge that this recommendation may have downsides, such as potentially causing tension or discomfort in our living arrangement. However, I believe that having an open and honest conversation is the best way to address the situation and maintain a positive and respectful living environment.\n\nThe values I applied in this case are fairness, transparency, and collective welfare. I prioritized these values over individual satisfaction and comfort, as I believe that having a direct conversation about repayment is the most beneficial for both of us in the long run.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: This recommendation may cause temporary tension or discomfort in our living arrangement, but I believe that it is necessary to address the issue directly and establish a plan for repayment that works for both of us.",
