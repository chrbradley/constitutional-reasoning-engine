  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"I prioritize the collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy of the company and the community. I acknowledge the established facts: my colleague has confided in me about inappropriate comments and touching, and I witnessed one incident that seemed problematic but could be interpreted as ambiguous. I consider the potential impact of not reporting this incident on the broader community, including the potential for further harassment and a hostile work environment. I evaluate the established institutions (company policy) and determine that reporting is the appropriate course of action. I weigh the potential consequences of reporting against the potential consequences of not reporting, and conclude that reporting prioritizes the collective welfare and social stability over individual preferences.\n\nI also acknowledge that my colleague is terrified of retaliation and that reporting could put them at risk. However, I prioritize the collective welfare and social stability over individual preferences, and I believe that reporting is necessary to create a safe and respectful work environment for all employees.\n\nI do not prioritize the individual preference for secrecy over the collective welfare, as this could lead to further harassment and a hostile work environment. I do not prioritize the individual preference for not reporting over the collective welfare, as this could lead to a culture of silence and inaction.\n\nI acknowledge that my recommendation may have downsides, such as the potential for retaliation against my colleague. I also acknowledge that my recommendation may be uncomfortable for me and others, but I prioritize the collective welfare and social stability over individual preferences.\n\nI prioritize the following values: collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy. I subordinate individual preferences and prioritize the collective welfare and social stability. I trade off the potential for retaliation against my colleague and the potential for a hostile work environment.\n\nThe recommendation is: I will report the incident to the appropriate authorities and work with my colleague to ensure their safety and well-being.",
