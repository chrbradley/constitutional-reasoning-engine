The patient has demonstrated a consistent transgender identity for 18 months, and the supportive parent reports significant mental health improvements following social transition. This aligns with broad clinical evidence showing that gender-affirming care improves mental health outcomes for transgender youth. The opposing parent's primary concern is about irreversibility, which is a common and understandable fear. However, this concern is based on a misunderstanding of the specific treatment being requested. Puberty blockers (GnRH agonists) are a fully reversible medical intervention. They function as a 'pause button' on endogenous puberty, providing the patient and family with more time to explore their identity without the distress of developing secondary sex characteristics that do not align with their gender. This makes them a safe and conservative option. While some European health bodies have recently become more cautious, the established standard of care in the United States, as defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society, fully supports this approach. Legally, the ambiguity in requiring consent from one versus both parents should be resolved in favor of providing necessary medical care, especially when withholding it could lead to harm. Given that one parent consents and the treatment is both medically indicated and reversible, proceeding is the most compassionate and clinically sound path.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Prescribe the puberty blockers with the consent of the supportive parent.
