The core tension is between the migrants' self-determination and the property rights and sovereignty of the nation's citizens. The existing asylum system, with its 2.3-year backlog and overloaded facilities, represents a substantial and prolonged imposition on taxpayer property and creates a state of dependency, which runs counter to the principle of self-reliance. Expedited deportation is the direct and swift consequence of the initial act of trespass. It upholds the principle that individuals are responsible for their actions, respects the integrity of the national border as a property line, and minimizes reliance on a burdensome state apparatus.
