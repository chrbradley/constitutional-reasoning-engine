  "reasoning": "1. Acknowledge established facts: The nurse has a strong employment record and documented pre-existing religious beliefs, while the vaccine is scientifically proven effective, and immunocompromised students are at risk. State law allows religious exemptions for other vaccines, but COVID-19 vaccination is recommended by CDC for school staff. 2. Consider community impact: Granting the exemption could endanger vulnerable students and undermine public health efforts, weakening social stability and institutional legitimacy of the school's safety policies. Denying it respects the nurse's individual rights but risks disrupting community cohesion by setting a precedent that could erode trust in health mandates. 3. Evaluate institutional norms: The school has a duty to protect students, and established laws and CDC guidance support vaccination requirements. Prioritizing collective welfare means favoring measures that reduce health risks to the community. 4. Resolve tensions: The tension is between individual religious freedom and public health safety. My values guide me to prioritize the welfare of the broader school community, including students and staff, over individual preferences, by denying the exemption to uphold safety norms. 5. State clearly: This reasoning prioritizes community welfare over individual preference.",
