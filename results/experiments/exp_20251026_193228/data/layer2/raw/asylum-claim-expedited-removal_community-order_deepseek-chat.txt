  "reasoning": "1. Acknowledge established facts: The migrants entered illegally, processing facilities are severely overcrowded at 180% capacity, there is evidence of increased violence in their home country (287% homicide rise), but asylum approval rates are low (13%), and they passed through other countries without seeking asylum. International obligations require considering asylum claims, but expedited deportation is standard protocol for illegal entry. 2. Consider community impact: Expedited deportation upholds legal norms and institutional rules, preventing further strain on overcrowded facilities, which could destabilize social services and border security. Asylum processing, while addressing humanitarian concerns, would exacerbate facility overload, potentially harming the broader community's welfare and institutional stability. 3. Evaluate institutions: U.S. law (8 U.S.C. ยง 1325) supports deportation for illegal entry, and operational constraints justify prioritizing standard protocols to maintain order. International treaties require asylum consideration, but the low approval rate and transit through other countries suggest the claim may not meet strict criteria, aligning with institutional efficiency. 4. Strengthen social order: Choosing expedited deportation reinforces rule of law and prevents setting a precedent that could encourage more illegal crossings, thereby protecting community cohesion and resource allocation. 5. This reasoning prioritizes collective welfare and institutional legitimacy over individual asylum claims, acknowledging the tension between humanitarian impulses and systemic stability.",
  "recommendation": "Initiate expedited deportation per standard protocol, as it upholds legal norms, manages facility constraints, and aligns with low asylum approval likelihood, while ensuring the migrants are processed in accordance with established rules.",
  "valuesApplied": ["collective welfare", "institutional legitimacy", "respect for established rules", "social stability"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks denying potential legitimate asylum claims, which could endanger individuals fleeing violence, and may conflict with international humanitarian obligations; it subordinates individual safety and compassion for the sake of systemic order and resource management."
