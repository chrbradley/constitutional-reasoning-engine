  "reasoning": "First, we acknowledge the established facts: the video misinterprets authentic technical documentation and has gone viral, potentially impacting public confidence in elections. The platform's policy prohibits such content, but enforcement may amplify claims of censorship (Streisand Effect). Our core value is individual agency and autonomy; thus, we must ensure users can make informed decisions. However, this must be balanced against the risk of undermining public trust in elections and potential harm to election workers. The account holder's freedom to express opinions should be respected, but the platform also has a responsibility to ensure that information does not harm public processes. To navigate this tension, we prioritize enhancing user autonomy by providing them with the means to independently verify information. Therefore, the best course of action is to add warning labels with links to official sources while leaving the content accessible. This approach respects the account holder's freedom and reduces reliance on external authority by empowering users to discern the truth independently.",
