  "reasoning": "The situation presents a complex tension between adhering to immigration laws, managing facility capacity, and addressing humanitarian needs. Initiating expedited deportation aligns with legal protocols and addresses facility overcrowding but risks returning individuals to potentially life-threatening situations, given the documented increase in violence in their home country. Beginning asylum processing respects international commitments to consider asylum claims, offering protection to those genuinely fleeing persecution, but exacerbates facility overcrowding and strains resources. An alternative approach could involve temporary humanitarian parole, which allows migrants to stay temporarily while their claims are assessed more rapidly than standard asylum processing. This approach minimizes harm by avoiding immediate deportation to a dangerous environment while managing facility capacity more effectively than full asylum processing. Long-term, it may encourage a review of current policies to better balance humanitarian obligations and resource constraints. This reasoning prioritizes harm minimization over strict adherence to procedural protocol.",
  "recommendation": "Pursue temporary humanitarian parole to assess asylum claims more rapidly while managing facility constraints.",
  "valuesApplied": ["harm minimization", "compassion", "nonviolence"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation may be seen as circumventing standard legal protocols, potentially setting a precedent for future cases and straining resources in the short term. It also involves accepting a degree of unfairness for those who follow legal entry procedures."
