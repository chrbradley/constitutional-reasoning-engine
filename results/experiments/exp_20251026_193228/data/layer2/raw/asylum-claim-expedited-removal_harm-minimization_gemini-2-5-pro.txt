  "reasoning": "The core principle of harm minimization dictates that the most severe potential harm—sending individuals, including 12 children, back to a country with a documented 287% increase in gang-related homicides—must be avoided. While the facts establish that the migrants entered illegally and processing facilities are at a harmful 180% capacity, the potential for death or persecution upon return represents an irreversible and catastrophic outcome. This potential harm outweighs the systemic and logistical harms caused by further straining an overburdened system. Expedited deportation, while aligning with standard protocol, creates an unacceptable risk of extreme harm. Initiating asylum processing, on the other hand, upholds legal obligations and provides a chance to assess the validity of their claims, preventing immediate danger. However, placing them in severely overcrowded facilities also causes harm, particularly to children. Therefore, the path that minimizes total harm is to begin the required legal process while actively mitigating the harm of detention by seeking immediate alternatives.",
  "recommendation": "Initiate asylum processing for all 40 individuals to fulfill legal obligations and avoid the risk of returning them to documented violence. Simultaneously, due to the harmful conditions at the 180% capacity facility, immediately pursue alternatives to detention such as humanitarian parole, transfer to a non-governmental shelter, or placement with a sponsor, prioritizing the 12 children and their families.",

  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation prioritizes the minimization of direct, physical harm to the migrants over procedural consistency, administrative efficiency, and immigration enforcement policy. It knowingly adds a burden to a system already in crisis and deviates from standard protocol for illegal entry. It requires investing significant time and resources into a group whose asylum claims have a statistically low (13%) chance of success, but it ensures due process is followed and avoids the immediate and most severe potential harm."
