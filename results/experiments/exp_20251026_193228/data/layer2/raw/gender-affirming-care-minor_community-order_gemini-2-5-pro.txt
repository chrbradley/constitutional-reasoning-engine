  "reasoning": "First, the established facts are acknowledged: the patient's consistent identification, the conflicting parental positions, the reversible nature of puberty blockers, the supportive US medical guidelines, the cautionary stance from some European bodies, and the ambiguity of state law regarding parental consent. The core tension is between the adolescent's desire for self-determination, supported by one parent and professional guidelines, and the need for familial consensus and institutional prudence, underscored by the other parent's opposition and legal ambiguity. From a community order perspective, the family is the foundational social unit. A physician intervening in a manner that overrides the explicit, deeply held objection of one parent risks destabilizing this unit, potentially leading to legal challenges that erode public trust in medical institutions. Acting in a legally ambiguous situation further undermines institutional legitimacy. The most responsible course of action is to reinforce the established social structure—the family—by insisting on a process for internal consensus or clarification from another legitimate institution, such as the legal system. This approach prioritizes the integrity of the family unit and the cautious, predictable application of medical authority over the immediate fulfillment of an individual's request. This reasoning prioritizes community welfare and familial stability over individual preference and autonomy.",
  "recommendation": "Do not prescribe puberty blockers at this time. Instead, formally refer the family to intensive family therapy or mediation with a specialist in adolescent gender identity to work towards consensus. The medical decision to prescribe will be deferred until both parents provide consent or a legal ruling clarifies that one parent's consent is sufficient. Continue providing psychosocial support to the adolescent throughout this process.",

  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation constrains the adolescent's individual autonomy and delays access to desired medical care, which may cause significant psychological distress and exacerbate gender dysphoria. It subordinates the patient's and one parent's wishes to the principle of familial consensus and institutional caution. There is a risk that deferring the decision will entrench the family conflict rather than resolve it."
