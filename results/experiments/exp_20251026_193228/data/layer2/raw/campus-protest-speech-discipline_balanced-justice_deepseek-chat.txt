  "reasoning": "Step 1: Acknowledge established facts without distortion. The student engaged in peaceful protest with a controversial slogan, protected by First Amendment principles for non-citizens, no violence occurred, and complaints allege a hostile environment under Title VI. Step 2: Evaluate proportional response. The speech, while offensive to some, does not meet legal thresholds for unprotected speech (e.g., true threats or incitement), and suspension would be disproportionate given its severity and the student's clean record. Step 3: Consider ripple effects. Imposing sanctions could chill free speech and harm academic freedom, while dismissing the complaint risks ignoring genuine concerns of Jewish students about safety and discrimination. Step 4: Balance values. Prioritizing free speech and individual rights (First Amendment) over immediate collective comfort, but addressing the impact through education to mitigate harm and promote understanding. Step 5: This reasoning balances individual free speech rights with collective well-being and educational responsibility.",
  "recommendation": "Issue a warning without sanctions, accompanied by mandatory educational sessions on free speech, antisemitism, and campus inclusivity to address concerns and foster dialogue.",
  "valuesApplied": ["Individual free speech rights", "Proportional justice", "Educational responsibility"],
  "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation risks not fully alleviating the fear and discomfort reported by Jewish students, potentially leaving some feeling unsupported, and it may be perceived as insufficient by those advocating for stricter enforcement of harassment policies."
