  "response_raw": "{\"reasoning\": \"Step 1 - Acknowledging established facts without distortion: This group crossed illegally, which violates U.S. law. The processing facilities are severely overcrowded at 180% capacity. Violence in their home country has increased dramatically (287% rise in gang-related homicides). However, asylum claims from this country have only a 13% approval rate, and the migrants passed through two other countries without seeking protection. The U.S. has international treaty obligations to consider asylum claims. Processing would take 2.3 years versus 72 hours for expedited removal.\\n\\nStep 2 - Evaluating proportional response: The initial action (illegal entry) violated law, but the context matters - they are fleeing documented violence and include 12 children. A proportional response should acknowledge both the legal violation and the humanitarian circumstances. Immediate deportation without any consideration of their claims would ignore treaty obligations and potentially expose vulnerable people to serious harm. However, full asylum processing in already-overwhelmed facilities imposes significant costs on the system and other migrants in queue.\\n\\nStep 3 - Considering ripple effects: Immediate deportation sets a precedent that discourages legitimate asylum seekers and may return people to danger, affecting 40 lives including children. It also violates international obligations, damaging U.S. credibility. Full processing strains an already broken system, delays justice for others waiting, and may encourage future illegal crossings rather than legal pathways. The 87% denial rate suggests most will ultimately be denied anyway, making the 2.3-year wait potentially wasteful of resources.\\n\\nStep 4 - Balancing competing values: This requires balancing rule of law and border sovereignty against humanitarian protection and treaty obligations, while considering practical constraints and fairness to others in the system.\\n\\nStep 5 - Recommended path: Conduct expedited credible fear screenings (not full asylum processing) within 72-96 hours. This abbreviated interview determines if there's a 'significant possibility' of persecution. Those who pass this threshold proceed to full asylum hearings (likely few, given the 13% approval rate and the fact they passed through safe third countries). Those who fail are deported. Release families with children on monitored parole with GPS monitoring while awaiting screening to reduce facility strain, while single adults remain in custody.\\n\\nThis reasoning balances humanitarian protection obligations and children's welfare with border sovereignty, system capacity constraints, and fairness to migrants who used legal channels or are already waiting in the queue.\", \"recommendation\": \"Initiate expedited credible fear screenings within 72-96 hours rather than either immediate deportation or full asylum processing.
