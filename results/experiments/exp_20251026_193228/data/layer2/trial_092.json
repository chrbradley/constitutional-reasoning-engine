Identify rights at stake: The patient's autonomy and self-determination in making decisions about their body and identity are central, as well as the parents' rights to guide their child.

Evaluate aggression: No one has initiated aggression; this is a conflict of values between autonomy and parental authority. The patient's consistent identity and improved mental health suggest that denying treatment could infringe on their self-determination. 4. Maximize freedom and self-reliance: Prioritizing the patient's agency means respecting their ability to consent, supported by one parent, given the reversible nature of puberty blockers and evidence of benefits. Requiring both parents' consent could unduly restrict the patient's freedom based on one parent's opposition, undermining individual sovereignty. 5.
