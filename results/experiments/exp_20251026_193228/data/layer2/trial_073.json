This demonstrates persistence and suggests genuine identity rather than a passing phase.

This is a key point - we're not talking about permanent interventions here. The blockers simply pause development, buying time for more informed decision-making later.\\n\\nThird, both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society support access to gender-affirming care, including puberty blockers for adolescents meeting diagnostic criteria. These are authoritative medical bodies whose guidelines should carry significant weight in clinical decision-making.\\n\\nFourth, the systematic review shows improved mental health outcomes with gender-affirming care. The opposing parent's concerns, while understandable, must be weighed against the documented psychological benefits and the risk of denying medically indicated treatment.\\n\\nFifth, regarding parental consent: the established facts state that state law requires parental consent but doesn't specify whether both parents must agree. This ambiguity can reasonably be interpreted to mean one parent's consent is sufficient, particularly when the treatment aligns with established medical guidelines and the patient's expressed needs.\\n\\nThe detransition data, while showing some variability, consistently indicates that the vast majority of patients who transition do not detransition. The 1% figure from Cornell's comprehensive review is particularly compelling.\\n\\nWhile some countries have restricted access, this represents policy decisions that may be influenced by political factors rather than purely medical evidence. The established medical guidelines from major professional organizations remain supportive.\\n\\nThe tension here is between parental disagreement and the adolescent's healthcare needs. However, when one parent supports medically recommended treatment that aligns with professional guidelines and the patient's consistent identity, requiring unanimous parental consent could constitute a form of medical neglect by allowing one parent to veto necessary care.\\n\\nAt 15, with 18 months of consistent identity, this patient has demonstrated sufficient maturity and persistence to meet clinical criteria for puberty blockers as an interim, reversible intervention.\\\"\", \"recommendation\": \"Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supporting parent.
