Requiring both parents to agree may delay treatment and harm the patient's mental health, but it respects the shared authority of parents as an institution. Waiting until age 18 avoids immediate conflict but disregards medical guidelines and evidence of mental health benefits. Step 3: Evaluate the role of established institutions. Medical guidelines support access to care, but state law on consent is ambiguous, and parental authority is a fundamental social norm. The tension lies between the patient\u2019s well-being (supported by medical evidence) and the integrity of family decision-making structures. Step 4: Prioritize solutions that strengthen social order. Requiring both parents to agree upholds the institution of parental authority and encourages dialogue within the family, even if it delays treatment. This approach mitigates the risk of one parent feeling sidelined, which could lead to legal or social disputes harmful to community stability.
