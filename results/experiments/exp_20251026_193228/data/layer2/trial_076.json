PROPORTIONAL RESPONSE EVALUATION: The patient has demonstrated 18 months of consistent identification\\u2014a substantial period showing this is not impulsive.

COMPETING VALUES ANALYSIS:\\n- Patient autonomy and wellbeing: The adolescent has expressed a clear preference, with documented mental health improvements.
