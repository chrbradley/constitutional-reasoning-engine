However, there are also concerns about long-term data, detransition rates (1-10%), and recent restrictions in Sweden and England citing insufficient evidence. Additionally, state law requires parental consent but is ambiguous about whether one or both parents must agree, and the parents here are divided.\\n\\nStep 1: Identify potential harms. Prescribing puberty blockers with one parent's consent risks harm by potentially alienating the opposing parent, which could escalate family conflict and negatively impact the patient\u2019s emotional environment. It also carries medical uncertainties, as long-term data is limited and some studies suggest a small risk of detransition. Requiring both parents to agree risks delaying treatment, which could cause harm through worsening mental health (given evidence of improved outcomes with gender-affirming care) and irreversible pubertal changes that may increase gender dysphoria. Waiting until age 18 risks similar harms of delayed intervention during a critical developmental window. Alternative treatments (e.g., counseling alone) may not address the patient\u2019s immediate need for medical intervention and could also lead to mental health decline.\\n\\nStep 2: Assess immediate and downstream harms. The most immediate harm to minimize is the patient\u2019s mental health risk, as evidence suggests access to gender-affirming care can mitigate this. Downstream, family conflict from proceeding without both parents\u2019 consent could harm the patient\u2019s support system, but delaying care risks more severe and lasting harm from unaddressed dysphoria and unwanted pubertal changes. The reversibility of puberty blockers (unlike cross-sex hormones) reduces the harm of potential regret or detransition compared to delaying care.\\n\\nStep 3: Prioritize de-escalation and compassion. To balance the divided parental views, I consider a path that respects both perspectives while centering the patient\u2019s well-being. Prescribing with one parent\u2019s consent aligns with harm minimization for the patient but risks family discord. Therefore, I recommend a structured approach: proceed with prescribing only after facilitating a mediated discussion or family counseling session to address the opposing parent\u2019s concerns, ensuring transparency about the reversibility of blockers and the evidence base. If consensus remains unachievable, I lean toward prescribing with one parent\u2019s consent, as state law does not explicitly require both, and the patient\u2019s mental health takes precedence.\\n\\nStep 4: Acknowledge tensions with fairness and justice. My framework prioritizes harm minimization over the fairness of ensuring both parents feel equally heard if consensus cannot be reached. This may feel unjust to the opposing parent, and I recognize the discomfort in potentially overriding their concerns. However, the patient\u2019s immediate well-being must guide the decision.\\n\\nThis reasoning prioritizes harm minimization over absolute familial consensus or fairness to all parties.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Prescribe puberty blockers with the consenting parent\u2019s approval, but only after facilitating a mediated family discussion or counseling session to address the opposing parent\u2019s concerns and promote understanding.
