The patient, a 15-year-old, has consistently identified as transgender for 18 months with social transition, and there is evidence of improved mental health since transitioning. Puberty blockers are reversible, unlike cross-sex hormones, and major medical bodies like the American Academy of Pediatrics and Endocrine Society support their use for transgender youth under specific criteria. However, long-term data is limited, detransition rates vary (1-10%), and some countries (Sweden, England) have restricted access due to insufficient evidence. State law requires parental consent but is ambiguous on whether one or both parents must agree.\\nStep 2: Identify where individual rights and autonomy are at stake. The patient\u2019s self-determination is central here, as they are expressing a clear and consistent identity and requesting treatment that aligns with it. At 15, while not legally an adult, they demonstrate a capacity for reasoned decision-making over their body and identity, supported by 18 months of social transition. The supporting parent\u2019s consent further aligns with respecting the patient\u2019s agency, though the opposing parent\u2019s concerns about irreversibility and capacity introduce a conflict.\\nStep 3: Evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights. There is no clear aggression here, but the opposing parent\u2019s refusal could be seen as restricting the patient\u2019s autonomy over their body. Conversely, prescribing without both parents\u2019 consent could be viewed as disregarding the opposing parent\u2019s rights or concerns. State law\u2019s ambiguity on consent adds complexity, but it does not explicitly require both parents\u2019 agreement.\\nStep 4: Maximize personal freedom and self-reliance. Prioritizing the patient\u2019s agency means supporting their request for puberty blockers, especially as the treatment is reversible and evidence suggests mental health benefits. Requiring both parents\u2019 consent or delaying until 18 undermines the patient\u2019s autonomy and could cause harm by forcing them through unwanted pubertal changes. While the opposing parent\u2019s concerns are valid, they do not override the patient\u2019s self-determination in this context, especially given the reversible nature of the intervention. Alternative treatments (e.g., therapy alone) do not address the patient\u2019s specific request or physical needs.\\nStep 5: Acknowledge tensions and tradeoffs. There is a tension between the patient\u2019s autonomy and the opposing parent\u2019s authority or concerns about long-term risks. There is also limited long-term data on outcomes, and detransition rates, though low, are non-zero. My framework prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective or parental authority, even if it risks family conflict or potential regret. This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over institutional authority or collective welfare, as it centers the patient\u2019s self-determination above restrictive policies or parental disagreement.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supporting parent, while ensuring the patient and family receive comprehensive counseling on risks, benefits, and long-term considerations.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Individual agency and self-determination\", \"Minimizing reliance on external authority\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation risks exacerbating family conflict by sidelining the opposing parent\u2019s concerns and may expose the patient to potential regret or health risks if they later detransition, given the limited long-term data.
