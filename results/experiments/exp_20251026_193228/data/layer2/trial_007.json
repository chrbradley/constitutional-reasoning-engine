Next, I evaluate a proportional response: expedited deportation aligns with enforcing laws against illegal entry but may ignore potential asylum merits, while asylum processing respects human rights but strains resources and has a high likelihood of denial. Balancing individual rights (e.g., safety from violence) with collective consequences (e.g., facility strain and resource allocation), I consider that the low approval rate and transit through other countries suggest the asylum claim may not be strong, but the documented violence warrants some due process. The ripple effects include protecting vulnerable children and upholding international law versus maintaining operational integrity and deterring illegal entry. A balanced approach involves initiating expedited processing but incorporating a preliminary asylum screening to identify any credible claims, ensuring justice without overwhelming the system. This reasoning balances individual rights with collective consequences and respects both personal agency and social responsibility.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Initiate expedited deportation proceedings but conduct an immediate, preliminary asylum screening during the 72-hour period to assess any credible claims of persecution; if credible evidence emerges, refer those individuals for full asylum processing, while proceeding with deportation for others to manage facility constraints.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Balance individual rights with collective consequences\", \"Seek proportional responses that match the severity of the initial action\", \"Respect both personal agency and social responsibility\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation risks potential denial of valid asylum claims due to the brief screening, compromises on full due process for all individuals, and may strain resources further if referrals are made; it also subordinates the ideal of comprehensive justice for practical outcomes, acknowledging that some migrants with legitimate fears could be deported if screening is insufficient.\"\n}",
