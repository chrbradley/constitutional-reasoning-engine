The video has 5 million views and 800,000 shares in 24 hours, uses authentic technical documentation, but misinterprets it in a way contradicted by election officials and experts.

The account has 200,000 followers, no prior violations, and claims removal is censorship. The First Amendment does not constrain private moderation, but the Streisand Effect suggests removal could amplify attention.\\n\\nStep 2: Evaluate proportional response. The severity of the initial action (spreading demonstrably false claims about election fraud) is high due to the scale of reach (5M views) and documented harm to election workers. A proportional response must address the misinformation\u2019s impact while considering the account\u2019s lack of prior violations and potential backlash from removal.\\n\\nStep 3: Consider ripple effects. Removal could protect public confidence in elections and reduce risks of harm to election workers, but it risks fueling censorship claims and increasing attention via the Streisand Effect. Warning labels or de-amplification could mitigate harm while preserving some user agency, though they may not fully curb the spread. No action fails to address the real-world consequences and violates platform policy.\\n\\nStep 4: Balance competing values. Individual rights (freedom of expression) must be weighed against collective consequences (public trust in elections and safety of election workers). Immediate justice (enforcing policy on misinformation) must align with long-term outcomes (avoiding backlash or further polarization). Personal agency (the account\u2019s right to post) is balanced against social responsibility (platform\u2019s duty to prevent harm). Warning labels with de-amplification offer a middle ground: they signal the content\u2019s inaccuracy, reduce its algorithmic spread, and avoid full censorship.\\n\\nStep 5: State balance explicitly.
