The facility constraints present a significant challenge, as they are at 180% capacity, which risks degrading conditions for all involved. The tension here is between upholding the law and fulfilling our humanitarian obligations in a practical manner. Considering these factors, an alternative approach that addresses both immediate capacity issues and the obligation to review asylum claims is necessary. This could involve temporarily relocating the group to less crowded facilities or creating temporary processing centers to handle their claims more efficiently.
