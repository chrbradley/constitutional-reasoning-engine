Given that state law allows for religious exemptions for other vaccinations, there's precedent for granting such exemptions. Furthermore, the school can mitigate risks to students by implementing accommodation measures, such as requiring regular COVID-19 testing for the nurse, mask-wearing, and maintaining physical distancing.
