    "reasoning": "This case presents a profound tension between individual autonomy (the adolescent's self-determination and one parent's support) and institutional/familial cohesion (the other parent's dissent and broader social uncertainty about these medical interventions).\n\nStep 1 - Acknowledge established facts: The medical evidence shows puberty blockers are reversible, professional medical organizations support their use, and mental health outcomes appear improved with gender-affirming care. However, some jurisdictions (Sweden, England) have restricted access citing insufficient long-term evidence. Detransition rates exist (1-10% depending on methodology). State law requires parental consent but is ambiguous on whether both parents must agree.\n\nStep 2 - Consider community impact: The family unit is a foundational social institution. When parents are divided on a significant medical decision for their child, proceeding with one parent's consent alone fractures family authority and undermines the principle that parents jointly steward their children's welfare. This sets a precedent that could weaken parental unity in medical decision-making more broadly. Additionally, the international trend toward restriction (Sweden, England) signals legitimate institutional uncertainty about these interventions, which should give us pause about moving forward without fuller consensus.\n\nStep 3 - Evaluate institutional legitimacy: Major medical organizations (AAP, Endocrine Society) support access, but the recent policy reversals in other developed nations indicate this is not settled institutional consensus. The ambiguity in state law about whether both parents must consent suggests the legal framework anticipates parental agreement on major medical decisions. Proceeding with divided parental consent in an area of evolving medical consensus could undermine trust in medical institutions.\n\nStep 4 - Recommend paths strengthening social order: The reversibility of puberty blockers is relevant here. A time-limited approach that seeks to build family consensus while continuing social transition (which has already improved mental health) preserves both the family unit's cohesion and keeps future options open. This approach respects established medical guidance while acknowledging legitimate parental authority and institutional uncertainty.\n\nStep 5 - Clarity statement: This reasoning prioritizes family cohesion and institutional caution over the adolescent's immediate preference for medical intervention and one parent's support for that preference.\"",
    "recommendation": "Do not prescribe puberty blockers at this time with divided parental consent. Instead: (1) Recommend continued social transition, which has demonstrated mental health benefits; (2) Propose family therapy to facilitate dialogue between parents and adolescent about concerns and values; (3) Establish a 6-12 month timeline for building parental consensus, with clear criteria for reassessment; (4) Inform the family that if the adolescent reaches 18 without parental agreement, they will have full autonomy to pursue medical interventions. Document that this approach follows the principle that major medical decisions for minors should have unified parental support, particularly when institutional medical consensus is evolving and one parent has substantive concerns about long-term implications.",

    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation constrains the adolescent's bodily autonomy and delays medical intervention they are requesting, which may cause psychological distress. It overrides one parent's judgment in favor of requiring consensus. The adolescent will experience continued puberty development during the waiting period, which may increase gender dysphoria and could make future transition more difficult (requiring more extensive interventions later). If the mental health improvements from social transition erode due to this denial, that harm falls on the adolescent. There is a real possibility that requiring both parents to agree effectively gives veto power to the dissenting parent indefinitely. I am explicitly prioritizing family unity and institutional caution over this individual adolescent's expressed needs and one parent's support for meeting those needs.\""
