    "reasoning": "The established facts confirm the video spreads demonstrably false information that violates platform policy and is linked to real-world harm. The core conflict is between the platform's social responsibility to mitigate this harm and the individual's expressive interest, coupled with the pragmatic risk that heavy-handed action could be counterproductive (the Streisand Effect). A proportional response must address the severity of the harm without resorting to a measure that could amplify the speaker's message. Outright removal, while seemingly decisive, is a maximalist response to a first-time violation and risks turning the user into a martyr for 'censorship,' potentially increasing their influence off-platform. Conversely, taking no action would be an abdication of the platform's responsibility outlined in its own policies and its duty to public safety. Therefore, a combined approach is most proportional. Algorithmic de-amplification directly targets the primary harm\u2014rapid, widespread reach\u2014without making the content 'forbidden fruit.' Adding a prominent warning label with links to authoritative refutations respects the viewer's agency to evaluate the information for themselves while directly countering the falsehood at the point of consumption. This reasoning balances the user's expressive interest and the risk of a censorship backlash with the platform's responsibility to mitigate widespread, demonstrable harm to public trust and safety.",
    "recommendation": "Apply two immediate, concurrent interventions: 1. Algorithmically de-amplify the video to significantly reduce its distribution in feeds, recommendations, and search results. 2. Superimpose a prominent, non-dismissible warning label on the video that clearly states its claims have been found false by election officials and cybersecurity experts, with direct links to their official statements.",

    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation is a compromise that will not fully satisfy any party. The false content remains accessible on the platform, which poses a continued, albeit reduced, risk and will be viewed as an insufficient response by those demanding complete removal. The account holder will likely still claim 'shadow banning' or censorship, and this action will not de-radicalize their committed followers. This approach prioritizes mitigating the scale of immediate harm and avoiding counterproductive backlash over the ideal of a completely sanitized information environment."
