The student, though an F-1 visa holder, is on the territory of a public university and is thus afforded First Amendment protections for political speech. The protest was peaceful and did not involve direct threats, incitement to imminent violence, or targeted harassment of individuals. The core tension lies between the protesting student's right to individual expression and the complaining students' right to an educational environment where they feel safe and free from harassment. From a self-sovereignty perspective, the initiation of aggression is the key determinant. The student initiated speech, not physical violence or a credible threat of it. The complaining students' feelings of fear and unsafety, while valid personal experiences, are a reaction to the interpretation of political speech. To punish the speaker based on the listener's subjective interpretation would be to grant the listener's emotional state authority over the speaker's autonomy. This empowers the university, an external authority, to become an arbiter of acceptable thought and speech, which fundamentally undermines individual agency. The university's code of conduct against 'harassment' must be interpreted through the lens of established First Amendment law, which sets a high bar (severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive) to avoid becoming a 'speech code' that chills protected expression. Since the student's actions were non-violent political sloganeering in a public space and not targeted harassment of specific individuals, it falls under the umbrella of protected speech. Disciplinary action would represent a coercive use of institutional power to suppress an individual's political expression.
