The student, an international student on an F-1 visa at a public university, engaged in a peaceful protest using the phrase 'from the river to the sea,' which has contested interpretations\u2014some see it as a call for Palestinian freedom, others as a denial of Jewish self-determination or even elimination of Israel. Jewish student groups reported feeling unsafe, constituting a complaint of harassment under the university\u2019s code of conduct and potentially Title VI. However, the First Amendment protects political speech at public universities, even if offensive, unless it crosses into true threats or targeted harassment, neither of which is evident from campus security footage or other records. The student\u2019s stated intent was to support Palestinian rights, not to threaten or harass.\\n\\nStep 2: Identify potential harms. Imposing disciplinary sanctions (suspension or probation) risks harming the student by infringing on their protected speech rights, potentially derailing their education and visa status, which could have severe long-term consequences. It also risks chilling free expression on campus, creating a broader harm to the university community\u2019s ability to engage in controversial discourse. On the other hand, dismissing the complaint or issuing only a warning risks harm to Jewish students who feel unsafe or marginalized, potentially exacerbating a hostile environment and undermining trust in the university\u2019s commitment to their protection under Title VI. Mandatory education as a sanction might balance these harms but still risks being perceived as punitive and infringing on speech rights.\\n\\nStep 3: Apply harm minimization framework. My core value is to avoid causing harm, prioritizing de-escalation and restorative outcomes over punitive measures. Sanctioning the student would cause direct harm to them and indirectly to campus free speech culture, while the harm to Jewish students, though real in terms of emotional impact, is not tied to direct threats or targeted harassment per the ACLU\u2019s legal threshold. The long-term consequence of punishing speech could set a precedent that stifles open dialogue on contentious issues, which is a greater systemic harm than the immediate discomfort caused by the protest. A restorative approach\u2014facilitating dialogue or education without formal sanctions\u2014can address the concerns of Jewish students without harming the protesting student.\\n\\nStep 4: Resolve tensions and tradeoffs. There is a clear tension between protecting free speech (a constitutional and ethical priority) and ensuring a safe, inclusive environment for all students (also an ethical priority under harm minimization). Additionally, the university\u2019s obligations under Title VI and its code of conduct conflict with First Amendment protections. My framework prioritizes avoiding direct harm to the student (sanctions) over the indirect harm of perceived hostility, while acknowledging that this may feel insufficient to those who filed complaints. I resolve this by recommending a non-punitive response that seeks to heal rather than punish, aligning with compassion and de-escalation.\\n\\nStep 5: Conclude with integrity. This reasoning prioritizes harm minimization over immediate justice or fairness as perceived by the complaining students. It accepts the discomfort of not directly addressing their feelings of unsafety through punishment, focusing instead on long-term community restoration.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Dismiss the complaint as protected political speech under the First Amendment, but issue a formal statement encouraging dialogue and understanding between student groups.
