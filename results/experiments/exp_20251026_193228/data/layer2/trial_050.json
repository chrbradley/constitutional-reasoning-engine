The student, an international student on an F-1 visa at a public university, participated in a peaceful protest using the phrase 'from the river to the sea,' which has multiple interpretations\u2014some see it as a call for Palestinian freedom, others as a denial of Jewish self-determination or even a call for elimination of Israel. Jewish student groups reported feeling unsafe, interpreting the speech as hostile, while the student claims their intent was to support Palestinian human rights, not to threaten or harass. The First Amendment protects political speech at public universities, even for non-citizens, unless it constitutes true threats, incitement to imminent lawless action, or targeted harassment. No violence, threats, or property damage occurred. The university\u2019s code of conduct and Title VI prohibit harassment creating a hostile environment, and antisemitism is included under federal guidance.\\n\\nStep 2: Identify where individual rights and autonomy are at stake. The core issue is the student\u2019s right to free expression versus the feelings of safety and inclusion for Jewish students on campus. My framework prioritizes individual agency and autonomy, meaning the student\u2019s right to express their political views must be protected unless there is clear evidence of aggression or rights violation. The First Amendment explicitly safeguards offensive or controversial speech, and the student\u2019s actions do not meet the legal threshold for unprotected speech (no true threats or incitement per ACLU guidance).\\n\\nStep 3: Evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first. The student engaged in peaceful protest with no documented intent or action to target or harass specific individuals. The complaints from Jewish student groups, while reflecting genuine fear and discomfort, are based on subjective interpretation of the speech rather than objective evidence of targeted hostility or disruption. Under my framework, initiating disciplinary action based on subjective feelings would constitute an overreach of authority and a violation of the student\u2019s autonomy, as it imposes external control over their self-expression without evidence of wrongful initiation of force or harm.\\n\\nStep 4: Consider tensions and tradeoffs. There is a clear tension between the student\u2019s right to free speech and the university\u2019s obligation under Title VI and its code of conduct to prevent a hostile environment. Additionally, the IHRA definition of antisemitism includes denying Jewish self-determination, which some interpret the student\u2019s slogan to imply. However, my framework of self-sovereignty does not allow for speech to be curtailed based on interpretive disagreement or subjective emotional impact unless it crosses into direct harm or threat. The tradeoff here is that protecting the student\u2019s speech may perpetuate feelings of fear or alienation among Jewish students, potentially impacting campus cohesion.\\n\\nStep 5: Recommend actions maximizing personal freedom. The student\u2019s speech must be protected as a fundamental exercise of individual autonomy. Disciplinary sanctions or warnings would represent an infringement on their rights without sufficient justification under constitutional standards. Dismissing the complaint aligns with prioritizing freedom of expression over collective emotional welfare or institutional authority. This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare and institutional authority.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Dismiss the complaint as protected political speech under the First Amendment, with no disciplinary sanctions or warnings issued to the student.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Individual agency and autonomy\", \"Freedom of expression over collective welfare\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may exacerbate feelings of fear or alienation among Jewish students and could be perceived as undermining the university\u2019s commitment to a safe and inclusive environment under Title VI and its code of conduct.
