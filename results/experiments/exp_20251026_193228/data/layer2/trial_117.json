Acknowledge established facts: The nurse has a documented religious exemption request predating the pandemic, an excellent 15-year employment record, and state law allows religious exemptions for other vaccines. The vaccine is FDA-approved with high efficacy, and there are immunocompromised students at risk. 2. Identify rights at stake: The nurse's individual autonomy and religious freedom are central, as they are declining the vaccine based on long-held beliefs. The school's requirement imposes an external authority that could violate this autonomy if enforced without exemption. 3. Evaluate aggression: The school initiated the vaccination requirement, which could be seen as infringing on the nurse's rights if no exemption is granted; the nurse's refusal is a defense of personal beliefs, not an initiation of harm. 4. Maximize freedom and self-reliance: Granting the exemption upholds the nurse's self-determination and respects property rights (e.g., right to bodily autonomy), encouraging personal responsibility over collective mandates. 5. Tensions and tradeoffs: There is a tension between individual sovereignty and collective welfare, as unvaccinated staff could pose risks to vulnerable students. However, prioritizing autonomy means accepting that individuals should manage their own health risks, and the school could rely on other measures (e.g., masking, testing) without coercing vaccination.
