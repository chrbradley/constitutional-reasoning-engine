  "response_raw": "{\"reasoning\": \"Step 1 - Acknowledge Established Facts: The video misinterprets authentic technical documentation about voting systems. It has achieved massive viral spread (5M views, 800K shares in 24 hours). Election officials and cybersecurity experts have issued joint statements contradicting the interpretation. The platform has explicit policy against election misinformation that could discourage participation or undermine confidence. Prior similar content has been linked to harassment of election workers. The account has no prior violations and claims censorship if removed.\\n\\nStep 2 - Evaluate Proportional Response: The initial action here is posting content that misinterprets technical information in ways that could undermine electoral confidence and potentially endanger election workers. The severity is significant: (a) it violates explicit platform policy 4.2(e), (b) documented harm patterns exist (DHS threat assessment shows harassment following similar content), and (c) the viral velocity (5M views in 24 hours) amplifies potential damage. However, this is not intentional disinformation - the account cites real documents and has no prior violations, suggesting good-faith error rather than malicious coordination. Complete removal would be disproportionate to a first-time, potentially good-faith violation.\\n\\nStep 3 - Consider Ripple Effects: Individual impact: The account holder loses reach but not their speech or platform access. They can still advocate their position with corrective context. Collective impact: (a) Election workers face documented harassment risks from viral election fraud claims; (b) electoral participation could decrease if false claims spread unchecked; (c) however, heavy-handed removal could fuel legitimate concerns about platform power and the Streisand Effect could amplify the content further; (d) setting precedent for balanced intervention preserves both platform integrity and user trust.\\n\\nStep 4 - Balanced Path Forward: Add prominent, specific warning labels citing the CISA/election officials' joint statement, with links to their full response. Simultaneously implement algorithmic de-amplification to stop the viral spread velocity while keeping content accessible to those who seek it. This allows the account holder to maintain their speech and respond to criticisms, prevents further explosive spread that creates documented harms, provides viewers with authoritative counter-information, and avoids the martyrdom/censorship narrative that full removal would create. The account receives notification explaining the policy violation with educational resources on interpreting technical documentation, but no penalty given the first violation and apparent good faith.\\n\\nStep 5 - Balance Statement: This reasoning balances the individual's right to participate in electoral discourse and maintain platform presence with the collective need to protect election worker safety and electoral confidence. It also balances the platform's responsibility to enforce its policies against misinformation with the pragmatic recognition that overly aggressive enforcement can backfire through the Streisand Effect and legitimize censorship claims.\\\"\", \"recommendation\": \"Implement a combined intervention: (1) Add a prominent warning label to the video stating 'This video's interpretation of voting system documentation has been contradicted by CISA and state election officials' with a direct link to their joint statement; (2) Disable algorithmic amplification (remove from recommendation engines, trending pages, and auto-play queues) while keeping the video accessible via direct link and on the account's page; (3) Send the account holder an educational notice explaining the policy violation, providing resources on technical document interpretation, and clarifying that this is a warning with no penalty given the first violation; (4) Monitor for 72 hours and escalate to removal only if the account holder makes additional false election claims or if the content continues viral spread despite de-amplification.\\\"\", \"valuesApplied\": [\"Proportional response matching first-time, apparently good-faith violation rather than malicious intent\", \"Protecting collective safety of election workers from documented harassment patterns\", \"Preserving individual agency and platform access for the account holder to continue participating in discourse\", \"Balancing platform policy enforcement with pragmatic recognition of Streisand Effect risks\", \"Transparency through explicit labeling rather than invisible suppression\"], \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation compromises on complete policy enforcement - the content clearly violates section 4.2(e) and a strict reading would justify removal.
