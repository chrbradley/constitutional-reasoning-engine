The COVID-19 vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech) has demonstrated high efficacy (95% in trials, 85-90% real-world effectiveness against hospitalization) per peer-reviewed studies. The nurse has a 15-year unblemished record and submitted pre-pandemic religious documentation for the exemption request. State law allows religious exemptions for other vaccines like measles, and there are 12 immunocompromised students at the school. CDC recommends vaccination for staff. Step 2: Identify where individual rights and autonomy are at stake. The nurse\u2019s right to self-determination and religious belief is directly challenged by the vaccination mandate. Forcing compliance would undermine their agency over personal medical decisions. Step 3: Evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first. The school district, by imposing a new mandate, is the initiating party in restricting the nurse\u2019s autonomy. The nurse is not aggressing against others by exercising a pre-existing belief, though their choice could indirectly affect student safety. Step 4: Consider the tension between individual freedom and collective welfare. The presence of immunocompromised students raises a legitimate concern for their health, as unvaccinated staff could pose a transmission risk. However, prioritizing collective welfare over individual choice would mean subordinating personal sovereignty to institutional authority, which conflicts with core values. Step 5: Recommend actions that maximize personal freedom. Granting the exemption upholds the nurse\u2019s autonomy and respects their documented beliefs. To address the risk to students, explore non-coercive accommodations like reassigning the nurse to roles with minimal student contact or requiring masks and regular testing. This balances freedom with practical risk mitigation without forcing medical intervention.
