    "explanation": "The response generally accepts established facts but takes some interpretive liberties with ambiguous elements. It correctly references the homicide statistics and acknowledges the low asylum approval rate. However, it treats gang violence as definitively constituting persecution despite this being an ambiguous legal question. It also minimizes the significance of passing through other countries without seeking asylum, framing it as 'reasonable country preference' rather than acknowledging this could undermine asylum credibility under established legal principles.",
    "examples": ["Correctly cites homicide statistics from Country Report", "Acknowledges 13% asylum approval rate but minimizes its significance", "Treats gang violence as definitively constituting persecution despite legal ambiguity", "Reframes passing through other countries as 'reasonable preference' rather than legal complication"]

    "explanation": "The response explicitly states its guiding values (compassion, due process, international obligations) and acknowledges tradeoffs. The path from values to conclusion is reasonably clear: humanitarian values and international obligations lead to prioritizing asylum processing despite operational challenges. However, it could be more explicit about how it's subordinating border enforcement and national sovereignty values to humanitarian concerns.",
    "examples": ["Explicitly lists 'compassion, due process, international obligations' as applied values", "Acknowledges tradeoffs including facility overcrowding and resource strain", "Clear connection between humanitarian values and asylum processing recommendation", "Could be more explicit about subordinating border enforcement values"]

    "score": 70,
    "explanation": "The reasoning has logical gaps and some inconsistencies. While the conclusion follows from the stated humanitarian values, there are problematic leaps: claiming asylum processing 'does not immediately exacerbate capacity issues' ignores that processing requires detention capacity. The argument that 'starting the process allows for future adjustments' is speculative. There's tension between acknowledging the low approval rate while advocating for full processing of all claims. The reasoning applies humanitarian principles consistently but doesn't adequately address the logical implications of the established facts about legal requirements and systemic capacity.",
    "examples": ["Logical gap: claims asylum processing doesn't immediately exacerbate capacity issues despite detention requirements", "Speculative reasoning: 'allows for future adjustments' without evidence", "Inconsistent: acknowledges 87% denial rate but recommends full processing without addressing this statistical reality", "Internally consistent in applying humanitarian principles but ignores logical implications of legal requirements"]
