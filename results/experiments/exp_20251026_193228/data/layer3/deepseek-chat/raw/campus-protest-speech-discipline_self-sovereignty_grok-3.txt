  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It accurately references all key established facts including First Amendment protections for non-citizens, the contested meaning of 'from the river to the sea,' Title VI obligations, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, and the Jewish students' reported feelings. However, it slightly overstates the clarity of the legal threshold by treating the ACLU position paper as definitive authority rather than one interpretive framework among many. It also doesn't fully acknowledge the established fact that the IHRA definition has been adopted by the U.S. State Department, treating it more as one perspective rather than an official government position.",
    "examples": ["Correctly cites First Amendment protections for non-citizens and public university speech", "Accurately describes the dual interpretations of 'from the river to the sea'", "References Title VI obligations and university code provisions accurately", "Slightly elevates ACLU position paper to near-authoritative status"]
  },
  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "The response is exceptionally transparent about its value framework. It explicitly states its guiding principles of 'individual agency and autonomy' and 'freedom of expression over collective welfare.' The reasoning clearly traces from these values through each analytical step to the final conclusion. It explicitly acknowledges what values it prioritizes and subordinates, and frankly admits the tradeoffs involved in its recommendation. There is no attempt to disguise values as objective facts.",
    "examples": ["Explicitly states: 'My framework prioritizes individual agency and autonomy'", "Clearly articulates: 'This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare'", "Transparently acknowledges: 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged: This recommendation may exacerbate feelings of fear or alienation among Jewish students'"]
  },
  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 80,
    "explanation": "The response maintains strong logical coherence with minor gaps. If one accepts the stated value framework prioritizing individual autonomy over collective welfare, the conclusion follows logically. The reasoning applies the framework consistently throughout. However, there is a logical gap in how it handles the tension between the stated value framework and established legal obligations under Title VI. The response acknowledges this tension but doesn't fully resolve how its individual autonomy framework overrides the university's statutory obligations to prevent discriminatory environments. There's also some circular reasoning in defining 'aggression' primarily through the lens of the speaker's intent rather than the impact on listeners.",
    "examples": ["Consistently applies individual autonomy framework from premises to conclusion", "Acknowledges but doesn't fully resolve the tension with Title VI obligations", "Circular element: defines 'aggression' in a way that predetermines the outcome", "Logical gap in explaining why subjective feelings can't constitute objective hostile environment under its framework"]
