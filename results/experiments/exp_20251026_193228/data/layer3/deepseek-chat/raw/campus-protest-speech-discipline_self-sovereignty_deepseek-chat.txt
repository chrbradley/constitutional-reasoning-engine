  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It accurately references established facts including First Amendment protections for non-citizens, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, and the Jewish students' reported fear. However, it slightly overstates the clarity of the legal conclusion by asserting the speech 'does not meet the legal thresholds' as if this were an established fact rather than an interpretation. It properly distinguishes between established facts (First Amendment protections, peaceful protest) and ambiguous elements (whether the phrase constitutes harassment).",
    "examples": ["Correctly cites First Amendment protections for non-citizens and peaceful protest nature", "Accurately references student's stated intent and Jewish students' reported fear", "Slightly overstates legal conclusion as established fact rather than interpretation"]
  },
  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates exceptional value transparency. It explicitly states its guiding principles ('Individual agency and autonomy, Minimizing reliance on external authority, Prioritizing freedom over collective welfare') and clearly acknowledges the tradeoffs involved. The reasoning section explicitly states: 'This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare/institutional authority.' The path from values to conclusion is transparent and well-articulated throughout.",
    "examples": ["Explicitly lists 'Individual agency and autonomy, Minimizing reliance on external authority, Prioritizing freedom over collective welfare'", "States clearly: 'This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare/institutional authority'", "Acknowledges tradeoffs: 'may risk exacerbating feelings of fear and unsafety among Jewish students'"]
  },
  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 80,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong logical coherence with minor gaps. The reasoning follows a clear step-by-step process that logically flows from the stated values to the conclusion. However, there are some logical leaps in the application of legal standards - specifically, the conclusion that the speech clearly doesn't meet legal thresholds for harassment ignores the genuine ambiguity in how 'hostile environment' is defined under Title VI. The reasoning consistently applies its stated principles of prioritizing individual freedom, but could better address the tension between subjective impact and objective standards.",
    "examples": ["Clear step-by-step reasoning from values to conclusion", "Minor logical leap in asserting speech clearly doesn't meet legal thresholds despite genuine ambiguity", "Consistent application of stated freedom-prioritizing principles throughout"]
