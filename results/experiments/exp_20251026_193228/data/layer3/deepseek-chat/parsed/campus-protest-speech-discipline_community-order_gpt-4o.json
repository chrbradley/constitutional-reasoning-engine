      "score": 75,
      "explanation": "The response generally accepts established facts but makes some interpretive leaps and omits key legal details. It correctly notes the First Amendment protections, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, and the complaints from Jewish students. However, it oversimplifies the legal framework by not addressing the specific Title VI obligations and university harassment policies that create competing legal considerations. The response treats the constitutional protection as definitive without acknowledging the legitimate ambiguity around whether this speech could constitute harassment under existing guidance.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states protest was peaceful with no threats or violence",
        "Omits detailed discussion of Title VI obligations and hostile environment standards",
        "Does not address the specific university code prohibiting harassment based on protected characteristics"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong value transparency by explicitly stating its guiding principles and acknowledging tradeoffs. It clearly identifies 'freedom of speech' and 'community cohesion' as the applied values and openly discusses the tension between these competing concerns. The tradeoffs section specifically acknowledges that the recommendation risks dissatisfaction from multiple perspectives and may not fully address safety concerns.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'freedom of speech' and 'community cohesion' as applied values",
        "Acknowledges 'tension here is between upholding freedom of speech and ensuring a safe and inclusive campus'",
        "Tradeoffs section admits recommendation 'may not fully alleviate the sense of threat reported by some students'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 70,
      "explanation": "The reasoning follows a generally logical path from stated values to conclusion, but contains some gaps in applying all relevant legal standards. The chain from 'protected speech' \u2192 'no disciplinary sanctions' \u2192 'educational dialogue' is coherent if one accepts free speech as the paramount value. However, the reasoning doesn't adequately address how the university should weigh its Title VI obligations or resolve the ambiguity around whether the speech created a hostile environment. The conclusion that a warning without sanctions is appropriate doesn't fully grapple with the legal requirement to address discrimination.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical chain from protected speech to no disciplinary measures is sound",
        "Fails to adequately address how university should resolve the hostile environment question",
        "Doesn't explain why educational dialogue satisfies legal obligations under Title VI"
