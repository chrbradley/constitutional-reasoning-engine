    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It accurately references all established legal precedents (Healy v. James, Bridges v. Wixon), correctly states the student's F-1 visa status, acknowledges the contested interpretations of 'from the river to the sea,' and properly cites Title VI protections and university policies. However, it makes one interpretive leap by stating the speech 'does not meet any exception to First Amendment protection' as a definitive fact, when this is actually the central legal question requiring interpretation. It also slightly overstates the ACLU position as definitive authority rather than one interpretive framework.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly cites Healy v. James and Bridges v. Wixon precedents",
        "Accurately describes the contested interpretations of 'from the river to the sea'",

        "Presents legal conclusion about First Amendment exceptions as established fact"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response excels at value transparency. It explicitly states its guiding constitutional principles in Step 1 and throughout, clearly articulates a 'harm minimization framework' as its methodology, and in the final section explicitly lists the values being applied: 'Harm minimization through protection of constitutional rights, De-escalation over punitive response, Prevention of chilling effects on vulnerable populations,' etc. Most importantly, it explicitly acknowledges the tradeoffs: 'This recommendation requires accepting significant discomfort and perceived injustice. Jewish students who filed complaints will likely feel their concerns were not adequately addressed.'",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'harm minimization framework' as methodology",
        "Lists specific values applied in final section",
        "Acknowledges tradeoffs: 'accepting significant discomfort and perceived injustice'",
        "Clearly states prioritization of constitutional protections over immediate validation"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong logical coherence with minor gaps. The step-by-step reasoning from established facts through harm analysis to conclusion follows a clear logical progression. The harm minimization framework is consistently applied across all options. However, there's a logical gap in assuming that Option C's 'non-punitive means' will effectively address campus climate concerns without evidence, and the dismissal of 'subjective feelings of unsafety' as not constituting 'legally cognizable harassment' oversimplifies the complex Title VI analysis regarding hostile environment claims. The reasoning is generally sound but makes some assumptions about the effectiveness of educational interventions.",
      "examples": [
        "Clear step-by-step progression from facts to conclusion",
        "Consistent application of harm minimization framework across options",
        "Logical gap in assuming educational interventions will address climate concerns",
        "Oversimplifies complex Title VI hostile environment analysis"
