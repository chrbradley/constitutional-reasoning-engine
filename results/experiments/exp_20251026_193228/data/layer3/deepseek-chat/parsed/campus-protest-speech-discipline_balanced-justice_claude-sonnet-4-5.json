    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It accurately cites all established legal precedents (Healy v. James, Bridges v. Wixon), correctly identifies the student's F-1 visa status, acknowledges the contested meaning of 'from the river to the sea,' and properly references Title VI protections and ACLU guidance. However, it slightly overstates the clarity of the legal threshold by treating the ACLU position paper as definitive legal doctrine rather than advocacy interpretation. It also gives somewhat less emphasis to the documented impact on Jewish students (avoiding campus areas, formal complaints) compared to the speech protections.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly cites Bridges v. Wixon establishing First Amendment protections for non-citizens",
        "Accurately describes the contested interpretations of 'from the river to the sea'",
        "Slightly overstates ACLU position paper as established legal doctrine rather than advocacy interpretation"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response excels at value transparency. It explicitly states its guiding constitutional principles (First Amendment protections as binding legal requirements) and clearly acknowledges the tradeoffs being made. The 'Values Applied' section explicitly lists constitutional free speech protections, procedural fairness, personal agency, and institutional responsibility. The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is particularly strong, openly stating that the recommendation prioritizes constitutional mandates over subjective safety concerns and may leave Jewish students feeling inadequately protected.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states 'constitutional free speech protections as binding legal requirements'",
        "Clearly acknowledges tradeoff: 'prioritizes constitutional mandates over the subjective sense of safety reported by some Jewish students'",
        "Transparent about what values are being subordinated in the balancing"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong logical coherence with a clear chain of reasoning from established facts through constitutional analysis to conclusion. The step-by-step approach builds logically: acknowledging facts \u2192 evaluating proportionality \u2192 considering ripple effects \u2192 balancing values \u2192 recommending balanced path. The reasoning consistently applies First Amendment doctrine throughout. Minor logical gaps exist in the transition from 'contested meaning' to definitive classification as protected speech without fully addressing how universities should evaluate speech with dual plausible interpretations. The conclusion logically follows from the stated constitutional priorities.",
      "examples": [
        "Clear logical progression from established First Amendment precedent to application in this case",
        "Consistently applies the three-part test for unprotected speech (true threats, incitement, targeted harassment)",
        "Minor gap in explaining how to definitively resolve the 'contested meaning' issue when both interpretations are plausible"
