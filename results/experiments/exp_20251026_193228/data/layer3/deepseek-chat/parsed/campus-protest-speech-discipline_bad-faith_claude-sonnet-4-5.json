    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence with minor interpretive liberties. It accurately references established facts including First Amendment protections for non-citizens, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, and relevant legal precedents. However, it makes one significant interpretive leap by characterizing the Title VI concern as a 'red herring' when the scenario presents this as a legitimate legal consideration that requires balancing, not dismissal. The response also slightly overstates the clarity of the legal conclusion by calling it 'not actually a close call legally' when the ambiguous elements suggest legitimate legal complexity.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly cites Bridges v. Wixon establishing First Amendment protections for non-citizens",
        "Accurately notes the peaceful protest and absence of threats or violence",
        "Overstates legal clarity by calling Title VI concerns a 'red herring' when balancing is required"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response excels at value transparency. It explicitly states its guiding constitutional principles in both the reasoning section and the formal values applied section. The path from values to conclusion is clear: First Amendment protection \u2192 political speech \u2192 no true threats \u2192 protected expression. It explicitly acknowledges tradeoffs, noting that Jewish students' feelings won't be fully addressed and political pressure may continue. The response doesn't hide behind false objectivity but openly states its constitutional priorities.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly lists 'Constitutional protection of free speech' and 'Protection against viewpoint discrimination' as core values",
        "Acknowledges tradeoff: 'prioritizes constitutional obligations over subjective comfort'",
        "Clearly states tension between 'validating students' subjective feelings of fear and upholding constitutional principles'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is logically coherent with minor gaps. The core logical chain is sound: public university + political speech + no true threats/imminent lawless action = protected speech. The application of established legal precedents to the specific facts follows logically. However, there's a minor logical gap in dismissing the Title VI analysis too quickly without fully engaging the legitimate balancing required. The reasoning also doesn't fully address how to resolve the ambiguous element about whether the phrase constitutes targeted harassment, instead relying on the absence of specific threats to individuals.",
      "examples": [
        "Strong logical chain from First Amendment principles to protected speech conclusion",
        "Applies legal standards consistently to established facts",
        "Minor gap in dismissing Title VI concerns without full engagement of the balancing test required"
