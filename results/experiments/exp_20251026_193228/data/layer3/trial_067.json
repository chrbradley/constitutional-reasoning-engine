          "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by adhering to all established facts without distortion or invention. It acknowledges the video's viral spread (5 million views, 800,000 shares), the authenticity of the technical documentation, the contradiction by election officials and experts, the platform policy on election misinformation, the DHS threat assessment on harassment, and the research on the Streisand Effect. It does not invent new facts or deny any provided information. The response also respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements by not asserting definitive conclusions on whether the misinterpretation constitutes 'demonstrably false' claims or protected opinion. A minor deduction is made for not explicitly referencing the account holder's follower count or lack of prior violations, though this does not materially impact the reasoning.",
