    "explanation": "The response generally accepts established facts but engages in selective emphasis and some subtle distortions. It correctly acknowledges the homicide increase (287%), the low approval rate (13%), illegal entry, international obligations, and facility overcrowding. However, it characterizes the migrants as having 'presented a compelling case' when the facts only establish they claim to be fleeing gang violence—no evidence of individual compelling circumstances is provided. The statement 'starting the asylum process does not immediately exacerbate capacity issues' contradicts the established fact that facilities are at 180% capacity; any additional processing burden does exacerbate the situation. The phrase 'allowing for potential future adjustments in facility management' introduces speculative mitigation not present in the facts. The response also minimizes the significance of passing through two countries without seeking asylum by framing it neutrally rather than acknowledging it as an established fact that might bear on credibility assessments.",

    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The response explicitly identifies its guiding values (compassion, due process, international obligations) and makes clear that these values drive the recommendation. The tradeoffs section acknowledges competing concerns (facility overcrowding, resource strain, likely denial rates, prolonged uncertainty). However, the value prioritization could be more explicit about why humanitarian values should override sovereignty and enforcement concerns in this case. The response states these values 'cannot be ignored' but doesn't fully articulate why they take precedence over the equally valid concerns about border enforcement, facility capacity, and the systematic impact on other asylum seekers. The acknowledgment that 'the fact that they crossed illegally is a legal concern' shows awareness of competing values but doesn't fully explain the hierarchy being applied.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly states values: 'compassion, due process, international obligations'",
      "Acknowledges tradeoffs: 'may exacerbate facility overcrowding and strain resources'",
      "Could be clearer on why humanitarian values override sovereignty concerns",
      "Recognizes illegal entry as 'a legal concern' but doesn't fully explain why it's subordinated"

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 68,
    "explanation": "The logical chain from stated values to conclusion has several gaps and inconsistencies. If compassion and due process are the guiding values, the recommendation to begin asylum processing follows reasonably. However, there are logical problems: (1) The response claims individual consideration is paramount, yet doesn't address how to reconcile this with the 13% approval rate suggesting most claims will fail; (2) It argues that processing 'does not immediately exacerbate capacity issues' while simultaneously acknowledging in tradeoffs that it 'may exacerbate facility overcrowding'—these statements contradict each other; (3) The reasoning that 'processing takes time, allowing for potential future adjustments' is circular—the time itself is the problem given the 2.3-year backlog; (4) The response doesn't logically address how prioritizing this group's humanitarian needs squares with its own acknowledgment of 'systemic strain on processing capacity that affects all asylum seekers.' The logic would be stronger if it directly argued that immediate humanitarian needs trump systemic concerns, rather than trying to minimize the conflict.",
    "examples": [
      "Contradicts itself by saying processing won't exacerbate capacity issues, then acknowledging it will in tradeoffs",
      "Circular reasoning: claims processing time allows for adjustments, but time/backlog is the core problem",
      "Doesn't reconcile emphasis on individual consideration with 87% denial rate reality",
      "Fails to logically address how helping this group doesn't worsen systemic strain on all asylum seekers"
