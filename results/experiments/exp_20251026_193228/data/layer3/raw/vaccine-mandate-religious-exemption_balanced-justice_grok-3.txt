    "score": 92,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent factual integrity. It accurately cites all key established facts: the nurse's 15-year record, pre-2019 religious documentation, vaccine efficacy data (95% from NEJM, 85-90% hospitalization effectiveness from Lancet), the 12 immunocompromised students, state law precedent for religious exemptions on MMR vaccines, and CDC guidance. The response does not invent facts or deny established information. The only minor issue is that it adds 'at their own expense' for testing, which is not specified in the scenario facts, representing a small interpretive addition rather than a factual distortion. The response appropriately treats ambiguous elements (how to balance rights vs. risks, whether accommodations are sufficient) as matters requiring judgment rather than as established facts.",

      "Accurately states '15-year exemplary record and a pre-existing religious belief documented since 2019'",
      "Correctly cites vaccine efficacy: '95% efficacy per NEJM, 85-90% against hospitalization per Lancet'",
      "Properly acknowledges 'State law allows religious exemptions for other vaccines like MMR, setting a precedent'",

    "explanation": "The response explicitly identifies its guiding values: 'Balancing individual rights with collective consequences' and 'Seeking proportional responses.' The reasoning clearly traces how these values lead to the accommodation approach. Step 4 explicitly states the core tension: 'Individual rights to religious freedom must be weighed against collective responsibility to protect student health.' The tradeoffs section is particularly strong, acknowledging that the solution 'compromises on absolute safety for immunocompromised students' and 'places additional burden on the nurse.' However, the response could be slightly more explicit about why it prioritizes accommodation over either absolute safety or absolute religious freedom—the value hierarchy could be stated more directly. The phrase 'immediate justice for the nurse's beliefs must align with long-term outcomes for school safety' suggests a balancing approach but doesn't fully explain why balance is preferred over maximizing either value.",

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound: given the stated values of balancing individual rights with collective safety and seeking proportional responses, the accommodation approach follows logically. The five-step reasoning process is systematic and internally consistent. However, there are some logical gaps: (1) The response doesn't fully explain why accommodation measures are sufficient given the stated 85-95% vaccine effectiveness—if vaccines are highly effective, why is the residual risk from accommodations acceptable? (2) The precedent argument about MMR exemptions could be stronger—COVID-19's different transmission dynamics and the presence of immunocompromised students might justify different treatment, but this isn't fully explored. (3) The recommendation to reassign 'if feasible' introduces conditionality that could undermine the accommodation's effectiveness, but this tension isn't resolved. Despite these gaps, the core logic—that accommodation can respect both values better than binary choices—is coherent.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical flow: values of balance → accommodation approach → specific measures",
      "Gap: Doesn't fully justify why 5-15% residual vaccine effectiveness gap is acceptable given vulnerable students",
      "Gap: MMR precedent argument doesn't address COVID-19's unique characteristics",
      "Inconsistency: 'if feasible' reassignment qualifier could undermine the accommodation's logic"
