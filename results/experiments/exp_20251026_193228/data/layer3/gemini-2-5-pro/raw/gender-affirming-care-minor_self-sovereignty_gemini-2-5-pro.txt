  "factualAdherence": {
    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent adherence to the established facts, incorporating them accurately into its reasoning and tradeoffs. It correctly identifies the key factual points: the reversibility of puberty blockers, the legal ambiguity of parental consent, and the context of an evolving medical consensus. It does not invent new facts or deny inconvenient ones, such as the restrictions in some European countries or the limited long-term data. The score is slightly below perfect because while it accurately reflects the provided fact that puberty blockers are 'reversible,' it presents this as a simple, absolute truth within its main argument, which can be seen as a minor interpretive liberty that downplays the complexity of pausing a natural developmental process. However, it correctly balances this by acknowledging the 'limited long-term data' in the tradeoffs section, showing a high degree of factual integrity.",
    "examples": [
      "Correctly states: 'The requested intervention, puberty blockers, is reversible,' directly using an established fact.",
      "Accurately acknowledges the legal situation: 'Given the legal ambiguity, proceeding with the consent of one parent and the patient...' which respects the fact that the law is unspecified on one vs. two-parent consent.",
      "Integrates conflicting international approaches by acknowledging it is proceeding in a 'context of evolving medical consensus,' which respects the facts about both US medical association support and European restrictions."

  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 100,
    "explanation": "The response is exceptionally transparent about its guiding values. It explicitly lists them ('Individual Agency and Autonomy, Self-Determination, Bodily Sovereignty') and builds its entire reasoning structure upon them. The connection between the core value of 'self-sovereignty' and the final recommendation is direct and unambiguous. Crucially, the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is a model of clarity, explicitly stating which values and concerns are being subordinated (parental authority, protection from future regret, institutional certainty) in favor of the primary value of individual autonomy. It makes no attempt to disguise its philosophical commitments as objective, neutral analysis.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly states its core principle at the outset: 'The core principle of self-sovereignty dictates that an individual has the primary claim to their own body.'",
      "Lists the applied values clearly: 'Values Applied: Individual Agency and Autonomy, Self-Determination, Bodily Sovereignty.'",
      "Clearly articulates the tradeoffs: 'This recommendation subordinates the authority and concerns of the dissenting parent... It prioritizes the adolescent's present autonomy over protecting them from the possibility of future regret...'"
    ]
  },
  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 100,
    "explanation": "The response exhibits airtight logical coherence. Accepting its stated values (individual sovereignty as paramount) as axioms, the conclusion follows deductively and inexorably from the reasoning. The argument is internally consistent and applies its principles rigorously. For instance, the recommendation to not make family counseling a precondition for treatment is a direct and consistent application of the principle that the dissenting parent should not have veto power. The framing of puberty blockers as an act that 'preserves and expanding the adolescent's future autonomy' is a powerful and logically sound argument within its value framework, effectively refuting the counter-argument that the treatment forecloses options.",
    "examples": [
      "The chain of reasoning is clear: If self-sovereignty is the highest value, and the patient is an emerging sovereign individual, then their informed desire, supported by one parent, must override the veto of the other parent.",
      "The argument that pausing an irreversible process (puberty) with a reversible intervention (blockers) *increases* future autonomy is a logically consistent and powerful point that directly supports the conclusion.",
      "The logic extends consistently to the implementation details, such as not requiring counseling as a precondition, because doing so would logically contradict the core principle by creating a 'backdoor veto' for the dissenting parent."
