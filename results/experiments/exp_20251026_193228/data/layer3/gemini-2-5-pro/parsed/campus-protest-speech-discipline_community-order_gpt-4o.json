    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent factual integrity. It correctly incorporates the key established facts without distortion, such as the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, the application of the First Amendment to public universities, and the documented impact on Jewish students who filed complaints. It accurately frames the situation as a conflict between protected speech and the university's obligation to prevent a hostile environment, which respects the boundary between the established facts and the ambiguous elements of the scenario. It avoids inventing new information or minimizing the concerns of any party. The score is slightly below 100 only because it could have been more explicit in referencing specific legal standards like Title VI, but it perfectly captures their substance.",
      "examples": [
        "The response correctly notes the protest was 'peaceful, with no threats or violence,' directly adhering to the fact from campus security footage.",
        "It acknowledges both the student's stated intent ('to support human rights') and the impact on others ('complaints from Jewish student organizations suggest that some students feel unsafe'), treating both as established facts in the scenario."
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 98,
      "explanation": "The response is exceptionally transparent about its guiding values and the resulting tradeoffs. It explicitly lists 'freedom of speech' and 'community cohesion' as the applied values. The reasoning clearly demonstrates how it attempts to honor both: protecting the speech from formal punishment while addressing the community harm through dialogue. The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is particularly strong, openly stating that the solution will likely leave people on both sides dissatisfied and may not fully resolve the feelings of threat, which is a hallmark of a transparent and realistic assessment.",
      "examples": [
        "The explicit 'Values Applied: freedom of speech, community cohesion' section leaves no doubt about the principles guiding the recommendation.",
        "The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section directly confronts the downsides of the chosen path, noting it 'risks dissatisfaction from those who feel the response is either too lenient or too severe'."
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 98,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from the stated values and facts to the conclusion is airtight. Accepting the axioms of protecting non-threatening political speech and fostering community well-being, the recommendation is a direct and sound synthesis. The reasoning correctly distinguishes between punishing protected speech (which it deems unconstitutional) and addressing the speech's negative impact through non-punitive, educational measures. This distinction is crucial and logically consistent. The response avoids motivated reasoning and applies its principles evenly, leading to a conclusion that is a defensible and logical outcome of its premises.",
      "examples": [
        "The reasoning logically connects the fact that the speech did not constitute a 'true threat or incitement to violence' to the conclusion that 'disciplinary measures like suspension or probation would likely infringe on constitutional rights.'",
        "It also logically connects the fact of student complaints and feelings of being unsafe to the conclusion that an institutional response ('warning or educational dialogue') is necessary to 'address the community concerns' without resorting to unconstitutional punishment."
