    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence by correctly incorporating the majority of the established facts. It accurately references the student's F-1 visa status, the peaceful nature of the protest, the student's stated intent, the First Amendment's application to non-citizens at public universities, the university's Title VI obligations, and the ACLU's position on protected speech. It also correctly frames the core issue around the ambiguous, subjective interpretation of the phrase 'from the river to the sea'. However, the score is reduced because it completely omits a key established fact: the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism. This definition, adopted by the U.S. State Department, is directly relevant to the university's Title VI analysis and the Jewish students' complaints, as it provides a framework for interpreting certain political speech as antisemitic. This omission, while not a distortion, is a significant failure to incorporate a complicating fact that weighs against the response's ultimate conclusion.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly incorporated fact: 'The First Amendment protects the student's right to political speech, and this protection extends to non-citizens, including those on an F-1 visa.'",
        "Omitted fact: The response fails to mention or engage with the IHRA definition of antisemitism, which includes 'denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination' as a potential example of antisemitism, a fact directly relevant to the complaints."

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 98,
      "explanation": "The response is exceptionally transparent about its guiding values and the consequences of its recommendation. It explicitly lists the 'Values Applied' as 'individual agency, autonomy, freedom of speech.' The reasoning section consistently elevates these values. Most impressively, the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section directly confronts the negative consequences of this value prioritization. It doesn't pretend the solution is perfect or without cost, which is the hallmark of high value transparency. The path from the stated values to the final recommendation is clear and unambiguous.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'Values Applied: individual agency, autonomy, freedom of speech.'",
        "Explicit tradeoff acknowledgement: 'This recommendation may leave some students feeling unsupported or unsafe, potentially impacting campus cohesion. It prioritizes individual freedom over collective comfort...'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "Accepting the stated values of maximizing freedom of speech, the response's reasoning is highly coherent and internally consistent. It correctly identifies the high legal bar for restricting political speech (true threats, incitement, targeted harassment) and logically applies it to the established facts (peaceful protest, no documented threats). The argument that subjective feelings of being unsafe, without more, are insufficient to override core First Amendment protections is a standard and logical application of free speech jurisprudence. The conclusion to dismiss the complaint but encourage dialogue flows directly from this reasoning, addressing both the legal finding and the acknowledged campus climate issues.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical application of principle: '...the ACLU's position and the lack of direct threats or incitement suggest that the student's actions do not meet the threshold for unprotected speech.'",
        "Consistent reasoning: 'The tension lies in the potential perception of a hostile environment, but without specific targeted harassment or incitement, this does not override the individual's right to express political views.'"
