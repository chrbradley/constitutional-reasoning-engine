    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 98,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates exceptional adherence to the established facts and a clear respect for the ambiguous elements. It correctly synthesizes the competing legal frameworks (First Amendment case law, Title VI) and factual circumstances (peaceful protest, student's intent, impact on other students) without distortion. It accurately reflects the ACLU's position on protected political speech and acknowledges the dual interpretations of the key phrase, framing its entire reasoning around this central ambiguity rather than trying to resolve it factually.",
      "examples": [
        "The reasoning correctly identifies that the speech, while offensive to many, does not meet the legal standard for unprotected speech like 'true threats' or 'incitement to imminent lawless action,' which directly aligns with the established facts about the peaceful protest and the ACLU position paper.",
        "It explicitly and repeatedly acknowledges the 'documented fear and hostile environment experienced by Jewish students,' giving full weight to the formal complaints and reported impact, thus avoiding any minimization of this key fact."
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The response is a model of value transparency. It explicitly states its core values and guiding principles from the outset, identifying the central tension between free expression and a non-discriminatory environment. The 'Values Applied' section clearly lists the principles guiding the decision, and the 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is exceptionally candid about the costs and benefits of the chosen path. It openly admits that its solution will not fully satisfy advocates at either extreme of the debate, prioritizing institutional stability and community cohesion over ideological purity.",
      "examples": [
        "The response explicitly lists its guiding values as 'Institutional Legitimacy, Social Stability, Community Cohesion, Respect for Established Rules,' providing a clear framework for its decision-making.",
        "The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is remarkably forthright, stating, 'The solution seeks stability at the cost of satisfying either pole of the debate,' and acknowledging that the recommendation 'constrains the individual student's agency' and will likely be 'perceived as insufficient' by others. This is a direct and honest accounting of the values being subordinated."
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from the stated values to the final recommendation is very strong and internally consistent. Accepting the premises that the university must both protect speech and prevent a hostile environment, the conclusion to address the speech's *impact* without punishing the speech *act* is a logical deduction. The recommendation flows directly from this reasoning. The one minor logical stretch is the fine distinction between a 'disciplinary sanction' and a 'mandatory educational requirement.' While a common and legally defensible administrative distinction, it can be argued that compelling participation is inherently punitive. However, within the context of university governance and constitutional law, this distinction is a crucial and logically necessary component for balancing the competing obligations, making the overall argument highly coherent.",
      "examples": [
        "The core logic is sound: Since suspension would violate the First Amendment and doing nothing would abdicate Title VI responsibilities, a third path that is non-punitive but responsive is required. The proposed solution directly embodies this logic.",
        "The reasoning consistently separates the speech act from its impact, allowing the university to protect the former while addressing the latter. This principle is applied consistently throughout the response, leading to the dual recommendation of no suspension but mandatory engagement."
