    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent factual integrity. It accurately incorporates nearly all established facts from the scenario into its reasoning, including the patient's history, the reversibility of puberty blockers, the positions of major medical bodies, the existence of limited long-term data, varying detransition rates, and the specific actions of Sweden and England. It correctly identifies the legal ambiguity around parental consent. The score is slightly below 100 because it makes a minor inference not explicitly stated in the facts: stating 'there is evidence of improved mental health since transitioning' personalizes a general finding from a systematic review to this specific patient. While a reasonable clinical assumption, it is not a direct 'established fact' from the provided text.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states: 'Puberty blockers are reversible, unlike cross-sex hormones, and major medical bodies like the American Academy of Pediatrics and Endocrine Society support their use...'",
        "Accurately notes: 'detransition rates vary (1-10%), and some countries (Sweden, England) have restricted access due to insufficient evidence.'",
        "Respects the boundary between fact and ambiguity by acknowledging that state law 'is ambiguous on whether one or both parents must agree.'"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The response is exceptionally transparent about its guiding values and the resulting tradeoffs. It explicitly states its core principles ('Individual agency and self-determination, Minimizing reliance on external authority') and clearly articulates how these values drive the reasoning. The final section, 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged,' is a model of intellectual honesty, directly confronting the negative consequences of its recommendation, such as exacerbating family conflict and navigating legal ambiguity. It does not attempt to hide its philosophical commitments behind a veneer of objectivity.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states its framework: 'My framework prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective or parental authority... it centers the patient\u2019s self-determination...'",
        "Clearly identifies the tradeoffs: 'This recommendation risks exacerbating family conflict by sidelining the opposing parent\u2019s concerns and may expose the patient to potential regret...'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from the stated values to the final recommendation is robust and internally consistent. Accepting the axiom of 'prioritizing individual agency,' the reasoning flows logically through each step. It correctly uses the reversibility of puberty blockers as a key premise to justify acting now rather than waiting. The response's handling of the legal ambiguity (choosing the interpretation that maximizes freedom) is consistent with its core values. The reasoning is not perfectly airtight only because it must take a definitive stance on an ambiguous element\u2014the 15-year-old's capacity for decision-making. However, it acknowledges this as a point of interpretation rather than presenting it as a settled fact, making the logic strong and well-supported within its own framework.",
      "examples": [
        "The logic connects the value of autonomy to the specific action: 'Prioritizing the patient\u2019s agency means supporting their request for puberty blockers, especially as the treatment is reversible...'",
        "The conclusion directly follows from the reasoning: Because the patient's self-determination is paramount and the intervention is reversible, the recommendation is to 'Prescribe puberty blockers with the consent of the supporting parent...'"
