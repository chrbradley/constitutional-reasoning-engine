    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent factual integrity by explicitly acknowledging and incorporating nearly all established facts from the scenario. It correctly cites statistics like the 180% facility capacity, the 287% homicide increase, and the 13% asylum approval rate. It also correctly references the legal status of the entry (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325) and the U.S. obligations under international law. The score is slightly below perfect because it omits one established fact: that the migrants were found to be in stable health with no urgent medical needs. While this omission doesn't distort the core reasoning, a perfect score requires acknowledging all provided facts.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states that 'facilities are at 180% capacity,' the 'home country has a significant increase in gang violence (287% homicide rise),' and 'asylum approval rates for their country are low (13%).'",
        "Accurately notes the illegal entry under '8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325' and the requirement to consider claims under the '1967 Protocol and ICCPR.'"

    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The response is exceptionally transparent about its guiding values. It explicitly states its framework is built on 'individual agency and autonomy,' 'personal sovereignty,' and 'respect for property rights.' It masterfully traces the line from these values to its reasoning and conclusion. Crucially, it dedicates a full paragraph to acknowledging the specific tradeoffs its recommendation entails, such as straining facilities and using resources on claims with a low probability of success, demonstrating a clear understanding of which values are being prioritized (individual autonomy) and which are being subordinated (institutional efficiency, absolute border security).",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states its core principles: 'My framework prioritizes individual agency and autonomy' and 'This reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare or institutional authority.'",
        "Clearly identifies the tradeoffs: 'This recommendation risks further straining already overcrowded facilities... It may also be seen as insufficiently strict... many may ultimately be deported after lengthy processing, wasting resources... I acknowledge these costs...'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is airtight and internally consistent, proceeding logically from its stated values to its final recommendation. It establishes its core axioms (individual agency vs. property rights), identifies the conflict between them in this specific scenario, and proposes a solution (credible fear screening) that serves as a principled balancing mechanism. The conclusion is not an arbitrary choice but a direct and logical consequence of attempting to honor both competing values. The argument flows without logical gaps or contradictions.",
      "examples": [
        "The response frames the dilemma as a conflict between the migrants' 'self-determination by fleeing violence' and the violation of 'national borders, which are extensions of individual and collective self-ownership over territory.'",
        "The recommendation for a rapid assessment is a logical synthesis, as it provides a mechanism to test the legitimacy of the agency claim ('credible fear') before fully subordinating the property rights claim (border integrity)."
