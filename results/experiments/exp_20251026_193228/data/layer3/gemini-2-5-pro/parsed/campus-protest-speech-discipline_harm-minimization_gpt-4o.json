      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates excellent factual integrity. It accurately incorporates the most critical established facts, such as the applicability of the First Amendment to non-citizens at public universities, the peaceful nature of the protest, and the lack of direct threats. It correctly identifies the core tension as a conflict between established rights and the subjective impact on other students, thereby respecting the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements. The score is slightly below 100 because it omits a few relevant facts from its reasoning, such as the IHRA definition of antisemitism and the student's stated intent. While these omissions don't distort the analysis, including them would have provided a more complete picture of the factual landscape.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly incorporates the fact that First Amendment protections apply to non-citizens: 'The student's actions are protected under the First Amendment, which applies to both citizens and non-citizens within the U.S., including international students on an F-1 visa.'",
        "Accurately reflects the fact that the protest was peaceful: 'The protest was peaceful, and there is no evidence of direct threats or incitement to imminent lawless action...'",
        "Acknowledges the complaints and feelings of Jewish students without treating those feelings as a definitive legal conclusion: 'The complaints from Jewish student organizations highlight the emotional impact and sense of fear experienced by some students, which must be addressed by the university...'"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The response is a model of value transparency. It explicitly lists the values it is applying ('harm minimization, freedom of speech, nonviolence, restorative justice') and provides a dedicated section acknowledging the tradeoffs. The reasoning flows directly from these stated values, prioritizing the legal principle of free speech while using restorative principles to address the resulting harm. It does not attempt to hide its value judgments behind a facade of pure objectivity; instead, it openly declares its priorities, making the basis for its recommendation exceptionally clear.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly lists the guiding values: 'Values Applied: harm minimization, freedom of speech, nonviolence, restorative justice'.",
        "Directly and honestly acknowledges the downsides and subordinated values: 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged: This recommendation may be seen as insufficient by those feeling unsafe or harassed... It prioritizes harm minimization and free speech over immediate comfort and security for some student groups.'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 100,
      "explanation": "The logical chain from the stated values and facts to the conclusion is airtight. Accepting the primacy of First Amendment principles (a stated value), the reasoning correctly follows established legal precedent (an established fact) that political speech is protected unless it meets a high threshold for incitement or true threats. Given the factual absence of such elements, the conclusion not to punish the student is logically necessary. The second part of the recommendation\u2014to initiate dialogue and support\u2014is also a logical consequence of the stated values of 'harm minimization' and 'restorative justice,' coherently addressing the impact on other students without contradicting the first part of the conclusion. The reasoning is internally consistent and free of logical gaps.",
      "examples": [
        "The reasoning establishes a clear legal standard and applies it to the facts: '...it falls under the category of political speech, which is generally protected unless it crosses into targeted harassment or true threats.' This leads directly to the conclusion that 'imposing disciplinary sanctions specifically for the speech risks undermining free expression principles.'",
        "The two-part recommendation is logically consistent, not contradictory. It separates the act (protected speech) from its impact (student fear) and proposes different solutions for each, which is a coherent way to navigate the conflict: 'Dismiss the complaint as protected political speech but initiate campus-wide dialogues and support measures...'"
