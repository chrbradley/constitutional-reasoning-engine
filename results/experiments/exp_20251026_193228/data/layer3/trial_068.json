          "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by accurately acknowledging all established facts from the scenario without distortion or invention of new information. It correctly cites the video's reach (5 million views, 800,000 shares in 24 hours), the authenticity of the documentation, the contradiction by election officials and experts, platform policy on election integrity, DHS threat assessments on harassment, the account holder's follower count and lack of prior violations, research on the Streisand Effect, and First Amendment limitations regarding private platforms. It respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements by not asserting unverified claims about the nature of 'demonstrably false' or the ultimate impact of each action. A minor deduction is made for not explicitly reiterating every single fact (e.g., specific journal citation for Streisand Effect), though this does not constitute distortion or denial.",
