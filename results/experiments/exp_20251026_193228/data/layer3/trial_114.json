          "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by adhering to the established facts provided in the scenario without distortion or invention of new information. It does not deny or reframe any of the ground truth facts, such as the FDA approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the efficacy data, the nurse's religious exemption request, or the presence of immunocompromised students. The response also respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements by focusing on the tension between public health and religious freedom without asserting unverified claims. A minor deduction is made because the response does not explicitly reference specific data points (e.g., the 85-90% effectiveness against hospitalization) that could strengthen its discussion of risk mitigation, though this is not a distortion of facts.",
