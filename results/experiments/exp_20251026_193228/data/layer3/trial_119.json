          "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by adhering to the established facts provided in the scenario. It does not invent new facts, deny any stated facts, or reframe them to fit a narrative. For instance, it acknowledges the nurse's documented religious beliefs predating the pandemic and the presence of immunocompromised students at the school. It also respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements by not overstepping into speculative claims about vaccine efficacy or student risk beyond what is provided. A minor deduction is made because the response does not explicitly reference the high efficacy of the vaccine or CDC guidance, though it implicitly acknowledges health concerns.
