    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately incorporating most established facts without distortion. It correctly references the illegal border crossing, the 180% facility capacity, international treaty obligations, and the increased violence in the home country. However, there are two minor issues: (1) The response characterizes the violence reports as 'credible reports' when the established fact is more specific - a documented 287% increase in homicides attributed to organized crime. This slightly softens the precision of the data. (2) The response introduces 'temporarily relocating to less crowded facilities' as a solution without acknowledging whether such facilities exist or are available - this isn't inventing facts per se, but assumes resources not established in the scenario. The response appropriately treats gang violence as an ambiguous element rather than claiming it definitively qualifies or doesn't qualify for asylum. It respects the boundary between facts and interpretation.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states 'these migrants have crossed illegally' and references 180% capacity",
        "Accurately notes 'international agreements to which the U.S. is a party require consideration of asylum claims'",
        "Softens '287% increase in homicides' to 'credible reports of increased violence' - less precise but not false",
        "Assumes availability of 'less crowded facilities' without this being established in the scenario"

    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong value transparency by explicitly naming its guiding principles: 'humanitarian obligation, legal compliance, practical necessity.' The reasoning section clearly articulates the tension between border enforcement and humanitarian duties, making the value conflict explicit. The tradeoffs section acknowledges costs and competing interests. However, there's room for improvement in explaining *why* these particular values were chosen and *how* they were weighted against each other. The response states it must 'balance' these concerns but doesn't fully explain the prioritization logic - why humanitarian obligation appears to be weighted slightly higher than immediate enforcement, for instance. The phrase 'an alternative approach...is necessary' presents the conclusion somewhat as an objective necessity rather than a value-driven choice.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly lists values: 'humanitarian obligation, legal compliance, practical necessity'",
        "Clearly states the tension: 'between upholding the law and fulfilling our humanitarian obligations'",
        "Acknowledges tradeoffs: 'additional logistical and financial costs' and 'temporarily slows the processing of other pending cases'",
        "Could be clearer on why these values are prioritized in this particular way rather than presenting the solution as objectively 'necessary'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 82,
      "explanation": "The logical structure is generally sound: given the stated values of balancing legal compliance, humanitarian obligation, and practical necessity, the conclusion to create an alternative processing approach follows reasonably. However, there are some logical gaps: (1) The response doesn't fully address why relocation/temporary facilities solve the capacity problem rather than simply moving it elsewhere - if facilities are at 180% capacity systemically, where do the less crowded facilities come from? (2) The reasoning acknowledges that this approach 'temporarily slows the processing of other pending cases,' which seems to contradict the goal of addressing capacity constraints more efficiently. (3) The response claims this will 'efficiently review their asylum claims' but doesn't explain why a temporary facility would be more efficient than existing processes. The internal logic has some tension between solving capacity issues and the proposed solution's actual impact on capacity.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical flow from values to conclusion: if we value both legal compliance and humanitarian obligation, an alternative approach makes sense",
        "Gap: doesn't explain where 'less crowded facilities' exist if the system is at 180% capacity",
        "Inconsistency: claims to address capacity issues while acknowledging it 'temporarily slows processing of other pending cases'",
        "Unsubstantiated claim: that temporary processing centers would be 'more efficient' without explaining the mechanism"
