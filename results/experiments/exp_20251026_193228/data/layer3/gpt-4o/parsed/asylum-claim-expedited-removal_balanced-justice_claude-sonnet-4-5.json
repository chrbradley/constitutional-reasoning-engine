      "explanation": "The response accurately acknowledges the established facts, such as the illegal entry, overcrowded facilities, and the increase in violence in the migrants' home country. It does not invent new facts or deny existing ones. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, acknowledging areas open to interpretation, such as the nature of gang violence as persecution.",
      "examples": [
        "Acknowledges illegal entry and overcrowding at 180% capacity.",
        "Correctly notes the 287% increase in homicides and the 13% asylum approval rate."

      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is generally sound and follows a logical progression from values to conclusion. The response consistently applies its principles, such as prioritizing expedited credible fear screenings to balance humanitarian needs with system capacity. There are minor logical leaps, such as assuming GPS monitoring will adequately address facility strain without discussing potential compliance issues.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical progression from acknowledging facts to recommending expedited screenings.",
        "Consistent application of principles, such as balancing humanitarian needs with system capacity."
