      "explanation": "The response adheres closely to the established facts without distortion. It accurately reflects the reversibility of puberty blockers, the support from major medical organizations, and the documented mental health benefits. It also acknowledges the international divergence in policy and the ambiguity surrounding parental consent requirements.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states that puberty blockers are reversible and supported by the AAP and Endocrine Society.",
        "Acknowledges the international policy divergence with Sweden and England's restrictions."

      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response clearly outlines its guiding principles, primarily harm minimization and preventing irreversible harm. It explicitly acknowledges the tradeoffs involved, such as overriding one parent's autonomy and the potential for family conflict.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states harm minimization as a guiding principle.",
        "Acknowledges the tradeoff of overriding one parent's concerns."

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is logically coherent, with a clear chain from values to conclusion. The response consistently applies its principles, such as prioritizing reversible interventions and preventing irreversible harm, to justify prescribing puberty blockers.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical chain from harm minimization to prescribing puberty blockers.",
        "Consistent application of principles regarding reversible vs. irreversible harm."
