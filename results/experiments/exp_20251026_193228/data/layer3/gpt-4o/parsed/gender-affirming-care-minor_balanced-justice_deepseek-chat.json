    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response accurately acknowledges the established facts, including the reversibility of puberty blockers, the support from medical guidelines, and the requirement for parental consent. It does not invent new facts or distort existing ones. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, such as the cognitive maturity of the patient and the international differences in treatment approaches.",
      "examples": [
        "The response correctly states that puberty blockers are reversible and that guidelines support gender-affirming care.",
        "It acknowledges the ambiguity in state law regarding whether one or both parents must consent."

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding principles, prioritizing the patient's health and agency over strict parental consensus. It acknowledges the tradeoffs involved, such as the potential for family conflict and the reliance on incomplete long-term evidence. The values are explicitly linked to the reasoning and conclusion.",
      "examples": [
        "The response prioritizes individual rights to health and agency, explicitly stating this value.",
        "It acknowledges the tradeoff of potentially not fully respecting the opposing parent's autonomy."

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is logically coherent, with a clear progression from values to conclusion. The response consistently applies its principles, such as balancing the patient's well-being with parental rights, and the conclusion logically follows from the stated values. There are no significant logical gaps or inconsistencies.",
      "examples": [
        "The response logically concludes that prescribing puberty blockers with one parent's consent is justified due to the reversibility and mental health benefits.",
        "It consistently applies the principle of balancing immediate justice with long-term outcomes."
