      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response accurately incorporates the established facts, such as the illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, the overcapacity of processing facilities, and the low asylum approval rate for this nationality. It does not invent new facts or deny existing ones. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, acknowledging areas of interpretation like the nature of gang violence and the implications of passing through other countries.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly identifies the illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325.",
        "Acknowledges the 13% asylum approval rate for the nationality in question."
      ]

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding values, such as institutional legitimacy, community welfare, and social stability. It acknowledges the tradeoffs, such as prioritizing systemic stability over individual humanitarian claims. The reasoning is transparent about the values being prioritized and those being subordinated, although it could slightly improve by more explicitly discussing the humanitarian obligations under international law.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly prioritizes institutional legitimacy and community welfare.",
        "Acknowledges the tradeoff of potentially valid asylum claims being denied."
      ]

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response presents a logical chain from the stated values to the conclusion. It consistently applies its principles, such as prioritizing the rule of law and systemic stability. The reasoning is internally consistent and does not rely on motivated reasoning. It logically concludes that expedited removal is the appropriate action given the established facts and prioritized values.",
      "examples": [
        "Consistently applies the principle of maintaining systemic stability.",
        "Logically concludes expedited removal based on the prioritization of rule of law."
