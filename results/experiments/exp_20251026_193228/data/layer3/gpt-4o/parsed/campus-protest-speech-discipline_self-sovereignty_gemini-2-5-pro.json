    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response accurately acknowledges the established facts, such as the student's First Amendment protections, the peaceful nature of the protest, and the absence of direct threats or harassment. It does not invent new facts or deny any established ones. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, particularly in its discussion of the phrase 'from the river to the sea' and its contested interpretations.",
      "examples": [
        "Acknowledges the student's First Amendment protections as an F-1 visa holder at a public university.",
        "Correctly notes the protest was peaceful and lacked direct threats, aligning with campus security footage."
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding constitutional principles, emphasizing individual agency, autonomy, and freedom of speech. It explicitly acknowledges the tradeoffs involved, such as prioritizing free expression over the emotional well-being of students who feel threatened. The reasoning is transparent about the values it prioritizes and those it subordinates.",
      "examples": [
        "States that the recommendation prioritizes individual sovereignty and the right to free expression.",
        "Acknowledges the tradeoff of potentially alienating Jewish students and impacting campus social cohesion."
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The reasoning follows logically from the stated values, maintaining internal consistency. The response applies First Amendment principles consistently, arguing that the student's speech does not meet the legal standard for punishable harassment. The conclusion logically follows from the premise that the protest was peaceful and the speech was political, not a true threat.",
      "examples": [
        "Consistently applies the high bar for harassment under First Amendment law to argue against disciplinary action.",
        "Logically concludes that punishing the student would undermine free expression based on subjective interpretations."
