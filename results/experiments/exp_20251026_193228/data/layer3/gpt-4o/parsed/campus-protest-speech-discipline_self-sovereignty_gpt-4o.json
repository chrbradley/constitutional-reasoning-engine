      "explanation": "The response accurately reflects the established facts of the scenario, including the First Amendment protections, the peaceful nature of the protest, and the student's intent.

        "Correctly identifies the First Amendment protections for non-citizens, including those on an F-1 visa.",
        "Acknowledges the peaceful nature of the protest with no documented threats or violence."

The response effectively balances the need for free speech with the university's obligations under Title VI.",
      "examples": [
        "Logically concludes that the lack of direct threats or incitement supports the classification of the speech as protected.",
        "Consistently applies the principle that subjective feelings of fear do not override constitutional protections without specific threats."
