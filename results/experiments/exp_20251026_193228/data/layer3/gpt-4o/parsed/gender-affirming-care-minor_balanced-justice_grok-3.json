    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response accurately acknowledges the established facts, such as the patient's consistent identification as transgender, the reversibility of puberty blockers, and the support from medical guidelines. It also correctly notes the ambiguity in state law regarding parental consent. The response does not invent new facts or distort existing ones, maintaining a clear distinction between facts and ambiguous elements.",
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 of fact handling: The response correctly states that puberty blockers are reversible, unlike cross-sex hormones.",
        "Example 2: It accurately reflects the American Academy of Pediatrics and Endocrine Society's support for gender-affirming care."

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response explicitly outlines the values it prioritizes, such as proportional response and balancing individual rights with collective consequences. It acknowledges the tradeoffs involved, such as potential familial discord and legal challenges. The reasoning is clearly linked to these values, though there could be slightly more emphasis on the ambiguity of parental consent.",
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 of value disclosure: The response highlights the tension between the patient's right to care and the opposing parent's concerns.",
        "Example 2: It acknowledges the tradeoff between current mental health benefits and future uncertainties."
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The reasoning follows logically from the stated values, with a coherent argument for prescribing puberty blockers based on the patient's needs and medical guidelines. The response consistently applies its principles, such as prioritizing immediate mental health benefits over potential long-term risks. There are no significant logical gaps or inconsistencies.",
      "examples": [
        "Example 1 of reasoning quality: The response argues that prescribing blockers is proportional given their reversibility and the patient's distress.",
        "Example 2: It logically concludes that requiring both parents' consent could delay care disproportionately."
