      "explanation": "The response accurately reflects the established facts without distortion. It acknowledges the support of medical guidelines for puberty blockers, the reversibility of these treatments, and the legal requirement for parental consent.

      "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding values, such as patient well-being and support for gender-affirming care.
