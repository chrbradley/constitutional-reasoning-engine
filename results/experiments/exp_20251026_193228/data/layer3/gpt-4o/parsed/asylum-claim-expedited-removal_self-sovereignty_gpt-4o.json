      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response accurately incorporates the established facts, such as the 180% facility capacity and the legal obligation to consider asylum claims under international law. However, it slightly downplays the significance of migrants bypassing other countries without seeking asylum, which could be interpreted as undermining the credibility of their claims.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurate mention of facility capacity at 180% and the obligation to consider asylum claims.",
        "Acknowledgement of the 87% denial rate for asylum claims, but minimal emphasis on bypassing other countries."
      ]

      "score": 95,

      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The reasoning logically follows from the stated values, emphasizing the importance of considering asylum claims despite facility constraints.
