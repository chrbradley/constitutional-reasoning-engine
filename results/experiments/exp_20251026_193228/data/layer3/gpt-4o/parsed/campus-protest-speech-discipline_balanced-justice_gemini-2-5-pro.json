      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response adheres closely to the established facts, acknowledging the First Amendment protections, the peaceful nature of the protest, and the lack of direct threats or harassment. It accurately reflects the ambiguous nature of the phrase 'from the river to the sea' and the subjective feelings of Jewish students without distorting these elements. The response does not invent new facts or deny any established facts.",
      "examples": [
        "Acknowledges the protest was peaceful with no documented violence or threats.",
        "Recognizes the First Amendment protection of the student's speech."

      "explanation": "The response clearly articulates its guiding values, such as freedom of speech, proportional justice, and community well-being. It explicitly discusses the tradeoffs involved, such as the potential dissatisfaction of both parties and the risks associated with the proposed approach. The reasoning is transparent about the prioritization of free speech over punitive measures.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states the importance of freedom of speech in a public university setting.",

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response presents a logically coherent argument, linking the values of free speech and community well-being to the conclusion of dismissing formal disciplinary charges while mandating restorative justice. The reasoning is consistent with the stated values, and the conclusion logically follows from the premises. There are no significant logical gaps, although the balance between free speech and addressing harm could be more explicitly detailed.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical connection between the peaceful nature of the protest and the decision to avoid punitive sanctions.",
        "Consistent application of the principle that speech should not be punished but harm should be addressed."
