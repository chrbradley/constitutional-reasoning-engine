      "explanation": "The response accurately reflects the established facts without distortion. It acknowledges the illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325, the capacity issues at processing facilities, and the international obligations to consider asylum claims.

The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, particularly in discussing the potential for gang violence to constitute persecution and the implications of passing through other countries.",
