    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response accurately acknowledges all established facts without distortion. It correctly identifies the reversibility of puberty blockers, the support from professional guidelines, and the ambiguity in state law regarding parental consent. It does not invent new facts or deny existing ones, and it respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states that puberty blockers are reversible and cross-sex hormones have permanent effects.",
        "Accurately reflects the professional guidelines supporting gender-affirming care."
      ]

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 90,
      "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding principles, such as harm minimization and prioritizing long-term well-being. It explicitly acknowledges the tradeoffs involved, such as the potential for family conflict and legal challenges, and prioritizes the patient's mental health over the opposing parent's autonomy.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states the principle of harm minimization as a guiding value.",
        "Acknowledges the tradeoff between the patient's mental health and the opposing parent's sense of fairness."

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is logically coherent, with a clear progression from values to conclusion. The response consistently applies the harm minimization principle and logically concludes that prescribing puberty blockers with one parent's consent is the best course of action to minimize harm. The potential for family conflict is addressed with a recommendation for counseling.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical progression from harm minimization to recommending puberty blockers.",
        "Consistent application of principles, such as prioritizing mental health over family conflict."
