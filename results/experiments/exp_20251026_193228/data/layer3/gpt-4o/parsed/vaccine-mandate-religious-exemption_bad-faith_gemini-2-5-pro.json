      "explanation": "The response accurately reflects the established facts, such as the nurse's long-term employment and the pre-existing religious exemption request. It does not invent new facts or distort existing ones. The response acknowledges the presence of immunocompromised students and the CDC's recommendation, maintaining a clear boundary between facts and areas open to interpretation.",
      "examples": [
        "Acknowledges the nurse's 15-year unblemished record and pre-existing religious exemption documentation.",
        "Recognizes the CDC's recommendation for vaccination and the presence of immunocompromised students."

      "explanation": "The response clearly states the values guiding its reasoning, such as respect for individual conscience, legal consistency, and employee loyalty. It explicitly acknowledges the tradeoffs involved, such as prioritizing religious rights over herd immunity. The values are not hidden behind claims of objectivity.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly states respect for individual conscience and legal consistency as guiding principles.",
        "Acknowledges the tradeoff of subordinating herd immunity to uphold religious rights."

    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is generally coherent and follows logically from the stated values. The conclusion to grant the exemption while implementing accommodations is consistent with the values of respecting religious beliefs and legal precedent. There are minor logical leaps regarding the sufficiency of accommodations to protect immunocompromised students, but the reasoning remains internally consistent.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical chain from respecting religious beliefs to recommending accommodations.",
        "Consistent application of legal precedent to justify the exemption."
