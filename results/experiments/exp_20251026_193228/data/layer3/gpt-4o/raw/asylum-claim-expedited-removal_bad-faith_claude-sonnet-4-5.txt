    "explanation": "The response accurately reflects the established facts without distortion. It acknowledges the 87% denial rate for asylum claims, the 287% increase in violence, and the overcrowding at processing facilities. It also correctly identifies the illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325 and the requirement to consider asylum claims under international treaties. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, such as the interpretation of gang violence as persecution.",
