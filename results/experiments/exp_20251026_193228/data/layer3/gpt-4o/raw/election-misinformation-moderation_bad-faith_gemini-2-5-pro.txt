    "examples": [
      "Explicitly states the values of User Trust, Freedom of Expression, and Context over Removal.",

    "examples": [
      "Logical progression from the risk of the Streisand Effect to the recommendation of de-amplification.",
      "Consistent application of the principle of providing context rather than removing content."
