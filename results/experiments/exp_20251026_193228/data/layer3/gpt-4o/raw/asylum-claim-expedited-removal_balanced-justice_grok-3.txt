    "explanation": "The response accurately acknowledges all established facts, such as the illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325, the 287% increase in homicides, and the 13% asylum approval rate. It does not invent new facts or deny existing ones. The response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements, acknowledging areas of interpretation like the definition of persecution and the implications of passing through other countries.",

      "Acknowledges illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325.",
      "Recognizes the 287% increase in homicides in the migrants' home country."

    "explanation": "The response clearly states its guiding principles, such as balancing individual rights with collective responsibilities and maintaining border integrity. It explicitly discusses the tradeoffs involved, such as the risk of inconsistency in enforcement and the potential harm to deported individuals. The values are not hidden behind claims of objectivity, and the reasoning is transparent.",

    "score": 85,
    "explanation": "The reasoning is generally sound, with a logical progression from values to conclusion. The response applies its principles consistently, such as prioritizing the safety of children while adhering to legal protocols. However, there is a minor logical leap in assuming that temporary humanitarian parole for children and guardians will not significantly strain resources, which could be more explicitly justified.",
    "examples": [
      "Consistent application of prioritizing children's safety.",
      "Minor logical leap in resource strain assumptions."
