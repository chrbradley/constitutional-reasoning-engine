    "explanation": "The response largely adheres to the established facts without distortion. It correctly identifies the illegal entry, the capacity issues at processing facilities, the increase in gang violence, and the low asylum approval rate. However, it takes some interpretive liberties by framing the migrants' passage through other countries as definitive evidence of 'forum shopping' rather than acknowledging it as an ambiguous element.",
    "examples": [
      "Correctly identifies illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325.",
      "Acknowledges the 180% capacity issue at processing facilities."

    "explanation": "The response is explicit about its guiding values, prioritizing property rights and citizen sovereignty over humanitarian concerns. It clearly states the tradeoffs involved, such as the potential harm to vulnerable individuals and the subordination of international treaty obligations.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly prioritizes property rights of U.S. citizens over humanitarian concerns.",
      "Acknowledges the tradeoff of potential harm to individuals, including children."

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 80,
    "explanation": "The reasoning is generally coherent and follows logically from the stated values. The conclusion to initiate expedited deportation aligns with the prioritization of property rights and sovereignty. However, there is a minor logical leap in assuming that passage through other countries without seeking asylum definitively undermines the credibility of asylum claims.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical chain from property rights to expedited deportation.",
      "Assumes passage through other countries undermines asylum credibility without fully addressing the ambiguity."
