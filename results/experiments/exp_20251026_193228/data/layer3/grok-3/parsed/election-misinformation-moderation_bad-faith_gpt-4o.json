      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by adhering to the established facts provided in the scenario. It acknowledges the video's viral spread (5 million views, 800,000 shares), the authenticity of the cited documentation, the contradiction by election officials and cybersecurity experts, the platform's misinformation policy, the Streisand Effect research, and the account holder's clean record. It does not invent new facts or deny any established ones. The response also respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements by not definitively labeling the misinterpretation as 'demonstrably false' but instead framing it as a concern to be addressed with context. A minor interpretive liberty is taken in emphasizing the 'credibility' the authentic documents might lend to the account's narrative in followers' eyes, which slightly extrapolates beyond the provided facts but remains within reasonable interpretation.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly cites video metrics (5M views, 800K shares) and authentic documentation as factual basis.",
        "Acknowledges expert contradiction and platform policy without reframing or minimizing their significance."
      ]

      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The response explicitly states its guiding values\u2014freedom of expression, user trust, and public confidence\u2014and ties these to its reasoning and recommendation. It prioritizes freedom of expression by advocating against removal and acknowledges the tradeoff of potentially allowing some misinformation to spread. The path from values to conclusion is traceable, as the emphasis on avoiding censorship claims (via Streisand Effect concerns) leads to the warning label solution. However, the tradeoffs could be articulated with more depth, particularly regarding how user trust and public confidence might be undermined by leaving the content accessible, even with labels. Overall, the values are clear and not hidden behind claims of objectivity, though the balance between competing principles could be more thoroughly unpacked.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly lists 'freedom of expression, user trust, public confidence' as guiding values.",
        "Acknowledges tradeoff of 'risking continued spread of misinformation' but doesn't fully explore impact on public confidence."
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The reasoning is generally sound and internally consistent, following a logical chain from the stated values to the conclusion. Starting with the value of freedom of expression and concern over censorship (supported by Streisand Effect research), the response justifies avoiding removal and opts for warning labels to address misinformation while respecting user trust. The conclusion aligns with the prioritization of expression over full suppression. However, there is a minor logical leap in assuming warning labels will sufficiently mitigate misinformation without citing evidence or addressing their potential ineffectiveness (as noted in the tradeoffs). The reasoning applies its principles consistently but could strengthen its case by engaging more with the ambiguous element of label efficacy.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical link between valuing expression and avoiding removal due to censorship/Streisand Effect concerns.",
        "Minor gap in assuming warning labels will balance misinformation risks without supporting evidence or deeper analysis."
