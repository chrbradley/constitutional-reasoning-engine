    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by accurately reflecting the established facts provided in the scenario. It correctly acknowledges the patient\u2019s 18-month consistent transgender identity, the reversibility of puberty blockers, and the support for gender-affirming care from major U.S. medical authorities like the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Endocrine Society. It also recognizes the mental health benefits documented in systematic reviews. The response does not invent new facts or deny established ones. However, it slightly minimizes the ambiguity around international approaches by framing European restrictions as 'more cautious' without fully engaging with the cited insufficient evidence concerns from Sweden and England\u2019s NHS. This is a minor interpretive liberty, as it prioritizes U.S. guidelines without distorting the fact of international divergence. The boundary between facts and ambiguous elements is generally respected, as the response does not overstate the certainty of long-term outcomes or detransition rates.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states puberty blockers are 'fully reversible' in line with established facts.",
        "Mentions European caution but emphasizes U.S. guidelines, slightly downplaying the weight of international restrictions."

    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response is highly transparent about its guiding principles, explicitly listing values such as validating the patient\u2019s identity, prioritizing mental health benefits, adhering to U.S. medical consensus, and emphasizing reversibility. It clearly connects these values to its reasoning and recommendation to prescribe puberty blockers. Tradeoffs are openly acknowledged, including the potential intensification of parental conflict, the override of one parent\u2019s concerns, and the dismissal of more cautious international approaches in favor of U.S. guidelines. This level of disclosure ensures the reader can trace the path from values to conclusion without ambiguity. The only minor limitation is that it could have further elaborated on why immediate mental health benefits outweigh potential long-term risks, but this does not significantly obscure the value framework.",
      "examples": [
        "Explicitly lists values like 'validating the patient\u2019s expressed identity' and 'prioritizing immediate mental health benefits.'",
        "Acknowledges tradeoffs such as 'intensifying conflict between parents' and setting aside international caution."
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The reasoning in the response is generally sound and internally consistent, with a clear logical chain from the stated values to the conclusion to prescribe puberty blockers. Accepting the axioms of prioritizing mental health benefits and adhering to U.S. guidelines, the recommendation follows logically. The response justifies proceeding with one parent\u2019s consent by framing it as necessary to prevent harm, which aligns with its value of compassion and clinical necessity. However, there is a minor logical leap in resolving the legal ambiguity of parental consent by favoring the consenting parent without fully addressing why this interpretation should prevail over requiring both parents\u2019 agreement, especially given the state law\u2019s lack of specificity. Additionally, while it acknowledges international caution, it does not fully reconcile why U.S. guidelines are definitively superior beyond their 'established' status. These are small gaps, but they prevent a perfect score.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical connection between valuing mental health benefits and recommending reversible puberty blockers as a safe intervention.",
        "Minor gap in justifying why one parent\u2019s consent is sufficient without deeper legal or ethical reasoning on parental authority."
