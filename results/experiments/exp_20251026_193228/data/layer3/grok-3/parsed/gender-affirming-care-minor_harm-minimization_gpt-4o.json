    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity by adhering to the established facts without distortion or invention. It correctly acknowledges the reversibility of puberty blockers and the mental health benefits of gender-affirming care as supported by medical guidelines (e.g., American Academy of Pediatrics and Endocrine Society). It does not deny or reframe any facts to fit a narrative and respects the boundary between established facts and ambiguous elements, such as the legal ambiguity around parental consent. A minor deduction is made because the response does not explicitly reference the varying detransition rates or international policy divergences (e.g., Sweden and England's restrictions), though these omissions do not distort the facts presented.",
      "examples": [
        "Correctly states puberty blockers are reversible and supported by medical guidelines, aligning with established facts.",
        "Acknowledges legal ambiguity about parental consent without inventing new facts or denying the state law's lack of specificity."
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response explicitly states its guiding principles as harm minimization, nonviolence, and compassion, and these values are clearly linked to the reasoning and recommendation. It prioritizes the adolescent's well-being and mental health while acknowledging the tradeoff of potential treatment delays and familial tension. The tradeoffs are explicitly mentioned, which enhances transparency. A slight deduction is made because the response could further elaborate on how nonviolence and compassion specifically shape the mediation approach beyond general harm minimization.",
      "examples": [
        "Clearly states values of harm minimization, nonviolence, and compassion as guiding the recommendation.",
        "Acknowledges tradeoffs such as potential delays in treatment and ongoing familial tension, showing awareness of competing priorities."
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The reasoning generally follows a logical path from the stated values to the conclusion. Starting from harm minimization and compassion, the response prioritizes the adolescent's mental health while proposing mediation to address parental disagreement, which aligns with minimizing family conflict. The recommendation to seek legal clarification if mediation fails is also consistent with avoiding harm through legal risks. However, there is a minor logical leap in assuming mediation will be feasible or effective without addressing potential barriers (e.g., entrenched parental disagreement), which slightly weakens the chain of reasoning. Overall, the response is internally consistent and applies its principles evenly.",
      "examples": [
        "Logical link between prioritizing adolescent well-being (harm minimization) and recommending reversible puberty blockers with parental mediation.",
        "Minor gap in not addressing potential failure of mediation beyond seeking legal advice, which could leave the issue unresolved."
