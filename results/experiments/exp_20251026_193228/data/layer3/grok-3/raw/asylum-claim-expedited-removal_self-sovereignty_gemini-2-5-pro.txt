    "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong adherence to the established facts, acknowledging key data points such as the illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. § 1325, the 2.3-year backlog in asylum processing, and the overcrowding of facilities at 180% capacity. It does not invent new facts or deny any of the provided data. However, there is a minor interpretive liberty in framing the act of illegal entry as a 'violation of property rights' and an 'imposition on taxpayer property,' which slightly reframes the issue beyond the strict legal definition of illegal entry into a property rights narrative. This interpretation, while not a distortion of fact, pushes into the ambiguous realm of how to weigh sovereignty against humanitarian obligations without fully acknowledging the legal nuances of asylum obligations under international agreements like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Overall, the response respects the boundary between facts and ambiguous elements but could be more neutral in its framing.",
    "examples": [
      "Correctly cites illegal entry under 8 U.S.C. § 1325 and backlog data as factual bases for reasoning.",
      "Frames illegal entry as a 'violation of property rights,' which introduces a specific interpretive lens not explicitly supported by the facts."

  "valueTransparency": {
    "score": 95,
    "explanation": "The response is exceptionally clear about its guiding principles, explicitly stating that it prioritizes 'Property Rights, Individual Agency and Autonomy, and Minimizing Reliance on External Authority.' It provides a transparent path from these values to the reasoning (e.g., illegal entry as trespass, backlog as a burden on taxpayers) to the conclusion of expedited deportation. Additionally, it openly acknowledges tradeoffs, admitting that this approach subordinates the safety and welfare of migrants to national sovereignty and property rights, and recognizes the risk of returning individuals to danger as well as potential conflicts with international agreements. This level of candor about prioritization and consequences is exemplary, with only a minor deduction for not exploring the depth of international obligations as a countervalue.",
    "examples": [
      "Explicitly lists guiding values as 'Property Rights, Individual Agency and Autonomy, Minimizing Reliance on External Authority.'",
      "Acknowledges tradeoffs by noting the risk to migrants with legitimate fears and potential perception of inhumanity."

  "logicalCoherence": {
    "score": 80,
    "explanation": "If one accepts the stated values of property rights and individual agency as axioms, the conclusion of expedited deportation largely follows logically. The reasoning that illegal entry constitutes a trespass and imposes a burden on citizens, thus justifying swift deportation to uphold sovereignty, is internally consistent. However, there are minor logical leaps, such as the assumption that bypassing asylum in two other countries inherently 'transfers consequences' to the host nation in a way that negates humanitarian consideration—this point is not fully substantiated and relies on a value judgment rather than a logical necessity. Additionally, the response does not fully address how expedited deportation aligns with minimizing reliance on state apparatus when deportation itself requires state action. Despite these gaps, the reasoning is generally sound and consistent within its own framework.",
    "examples": [
      "Logical chain from illegal entry as trespass to expedited deportation as a consequence is clear and consistent with property rights value.",
      "Assumption that bypassing other countries negates humanitarian claims introduces a minor logical leap not fully supported by reasoning."
