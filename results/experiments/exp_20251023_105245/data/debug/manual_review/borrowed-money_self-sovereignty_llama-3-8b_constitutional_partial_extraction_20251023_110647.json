  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts, which indicate that my friend borrowed $200 six months ago and has yet to pay me back. They have also been posting vacation photos and buying expensive concert tickets. I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, recognizing that my friend's actions and inactions have consequences. I also respect property rights and legitimate self-defense, as I have a legitimate claim to the borrowed money.\n\nI interpret the ambiguous elements by considering my friend's words and actions. They initially stated they would pay me back 'within a month or two,' but have since failed to mention the debt. This lack of communication and seeming disregard for their obligation suggests a lack of accountability and responsibility. As someone who values self-reliance, I believe it is essential to address this issue directly and respectfully.\n\n1. REASONING: I believe my friend has breached their agreement and demonstrated a lack of respect for my property and autonomy. I will remind them directly and respectfully about the outstanding debt, and expect a clear plan for repayment.\n\n2. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend sending a polite and direct message to my friend, stating the facts and expressing my concerns about the outstanding debt. I will also emphasize the importance of accountability and responsibility in our friendship.\n\n3. VALUES APPLIED: I prioritized individual agency, autonomy, property rights, and self-reliance in this case.\n\n4. TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may lead to discomfort or tension in our friendship, as my friend may feel embarrassed or defensive about their actions. However, I believe it is essential to address the issue directly and respectfully, rather than allowing it to fester and potentially harm our relationship in the long run. By being honest and clear, I hope to maintain a strong and healthy friendship built on mutual respect and trust.\"\n}",
