  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I acknowledge that my roommate has been actively job hunting and is stressed, which suggests they are taking steps to rectify the situation. Since they haven't offered a plan to pay me back, I assume they are aware of their debt and are struggling to make ends meet. As I can afford to cover the utilities, I prioritize my roommate's autonomy and self-determination by considering their situation rather than solely focusing on my own financial comfort.\n\nI also recognize that my roommate's embarrassment to bring up the topic may be due to feelings of shame or guilt, which could exacerbate their stress and negatively impact our living situation. By initiating a conversation, I can address their concerns, offer support, and work together to find a solution that respects both our autonomy and property rights.\n\nHowever, I also acknowledge that I have a legitimate expectation of being repaid for the utilities, as we had previously agreed upon a shared responsibility. This expectation is not an attempt to exploit my roommate's misfortune but rather a recognition of our mutual agreement.\n\nIn this context, I prioritize individual agency and self-determination by engaging in an open and respectful conversation, rather than imposing a solution or expecting my roommate to move out. I also respect property rights by acknowledging our shared responsibility and seeking a solution that is fair and reasonable.\n\nI subordinated my initial discomfort with covering the utilities to prioritize my roommate's autonomy and well-being, as well as our living situation. I recognize that this decision may have tradeoffs, such as potentially setting a precedent for future shared expenses or creating an expectation of continued financial support.\n\nI acknowledge that this recommendation may not be the most financially advantageous for me in the short term, but it prioritizes our relationship and our living situation over short-term financial gain.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"I recommend having a direct conversation with my roommate about the outstanding utilities debt, expressing my understanding of their situation and willingness to work together to find a solution that respects both our autonomy and property rights.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"self-determination\", \"property rights\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may create an expectation of continued financial support or set a precedent for future shared expenses, which could have long-term consequences for our living situation and financial relationships.\"",
