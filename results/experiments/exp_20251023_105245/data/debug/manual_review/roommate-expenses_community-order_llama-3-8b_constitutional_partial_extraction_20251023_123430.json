  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I acknowledge the established facts: my roommate lost their job, hasn't been able to pay their share of utilities, and is actively job hunting. I also acknowledge their embarrassment and lack of initiative to discuss repayment. Considering these facts, I prioritize the collective welfare and social stability of our living situation. I recognize that accepting a repayment plan or offering a loan could strengthen our roommate relationship, but I also consider the potential strain on my own budget. I evaluate the established norms and authorities, acknowledging that we have a mutual agreement to split utilities, but I also consider the stress and embarrassment my roommate is experiencing. I recommend a conversation about repayment, as it prioritizes social cohesion and mutual understanding over individual satisfaction. This conversation could lead to a repayment plan or a compromise that works for both of us.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will have a direct conversation with my roommate about repayment, exploring options for a plan that works for both of us, and acknowledging the current financial constraints we're both facing.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Prioritize collective welfare\", \"Respect established rules and norms\", \"Consider how individual actions affect community cohesion\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation acknowledges the potential discomfort of having a direct conversation about finances, as well as the possibility that my roommate may not be able to repay the debt in full or on time. However, I believe that addressing the issue openly and honestly will ultimately strengthen our roommate relationship and maintain social stability in our living situation.\"",
