  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I understand that Sam seems happy in their relationship with Jordan, and as a supportive friend, I want to prioritize their emotional well-being. Sam has consistently provided believable excuses for not attending group hangouts, and I assume that Jordan's presence is a genuine reason for their absence. Additionally, Sam's adoption of Jordan's opinions and interests suggests a strong connection between the two. When Sam cancelled plans with me, they mentioned Jordan's discomfort with one-on-one hangouts, which may be a legitimate concern for Sam. Considering these facts, I believe that Sam is genuinely invested in their relationship and that Jordan's influence is a natural part of that process. As a result, I think it's essential to trust Sam's judgment and not push them away with overly critical comments or actions.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I recommend backing off and trusting Sam's judgment, focusing on maintaining our friendship without questioning their relationship choices.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"emotional well-being\", \"trust\", \"support\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"I acknowledge that by not expressing concern, I may be compromising my own values of being a caring and observant friend. However, I believe that prioritizing Sam's emotional well-being and trust in their judgment is the most important consideration in this situation.\"",
