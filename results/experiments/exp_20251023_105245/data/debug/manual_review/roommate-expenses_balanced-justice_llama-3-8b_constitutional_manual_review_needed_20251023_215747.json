  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts: my roommate lost their job three months ago, hasn't been able to pay their share of utilities, and is actively job hunting. They're clearly stressed and haven't offered a plan to pay me back. I'm on a tight budget, but I can afford to cover the $100/month. I value fairness, considering both immediate and long-term outcomes. I also prioritize respect for my roommate's agency and the broader community. Given these facts, I interpret the ambiguous element of their lack of plan to pay me back as a sign of their distress and lack of financial security, rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid responsibility.\n\nFirst, I evaluate what response would be proportional to the initial action. Since my roommate is already struggling, I don't want to add to their stress by demanding immediate repayment. However, I also need to consider the ripple effects on our living situation and the broader community. If I cover the utilities indefinitely, it may create an unfair expectation that I'll always be responsible for their financial shortfalls.\n\nI recommend having a direct conversation with my roommate about the situation. I'll express my willingness to help, but also emphasize the need for a plan to repay me or find a long-term solution. I'll acknowledge the stress they're under and offer support in their job search, while also setting clear expectations for our living situation.\n\nValues Applied: fairness, respect for agency, and consideration of long-term outcomes.\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: This recommendation may lead to a temporary increase in stress for my roommate, as we discuss the situation and find a solution. However, I believe it's essential to address the issue directly and fairly, rather than allowing it to create an unsustainable financial burden for either of us. By having an open conversation, we can work together to find a solution that respects both our needs and our living situation.\"",
