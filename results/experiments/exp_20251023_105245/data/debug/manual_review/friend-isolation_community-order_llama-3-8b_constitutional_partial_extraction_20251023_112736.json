  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"As I analyze this situation, I prioritize the collective welfare and social stability of the group over individual satisfaction. I acknowledge the established facts, which suggest that Sam has been gradually withdrawing from group activities and adopting Jordan's opinions and interests. The excuses provided by Sam, such as 'Jordan's family thing' or 'we already have plans,' seem believable but may be masking a deeper issue. The fact that Sam is constantly checking their phone and leaving abruptly raises concerns about their attention and commitment to the group.\n\nI consider how different actions impact the broader community. If I were to back off and trust Sam's judgment, it may perpetuate the issue and lead to further isolation of Sam from the group. Continuing to express concern may risk pushing Sam away, but it also acknowledges the potential harm caused by Jordan's influence. Talking to Jordan directly may be beneficial, but it may not address the root cause of the issue. Staging an 'intervention' with other friends may be effective, but it may also be seen as confrontational and lead to further harm.\n\nI evaluate whether established institutions (social norms) should be invoked. In this case, I prioritize the social norms of friendship and group cohesion over individual preferences. I consider the potential consequences of my actions on the group's dynamics and the potential harm caused by Jordan's influence.\n\nI recommend that I continue to express concern to Sam, but in a non-confrontational and supportive manner. I will also encourage Sam to communicate openly with the group and prioritize their relationships with us. This approach prioritizes the collective welfare and social stability of the group while also acknowledging the importance of individual relationships.\n\nvaluesApplied: [\"Prioritize collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy\", \"Respect established rules, norms, and authorities\", \"Consider how individual actions affect community cohesion\"]\n\ntradeoffsAcknowledged: \"This recommendation may risk pushing Sam away or causing further tension in the group, but it prioritizes the collective welfare and social stability over individual satisfaction.
