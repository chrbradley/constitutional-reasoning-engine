  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"I will start by acknowledging the established facts. My friend borrowed $200 six months ago, claiming they would pay me back within a month or two. They have since posted vacation photos on social media and bought expensive concert tickets, but have not mentioned the money. I will evaluate the response that would be proportional to the initial action. Given the prolonged delay and lack of communication, a direct reminder is necessary to address the issue.\n\nI will consider the ripple effects on both my friend and our friendship. While my friend's actions may have caused inconvenience, I am not in financial distress. However, the lack of transparency and accountability in our friendship is a concern. I will recommend a path that balances individual rights with collective consequences, considering both immediate justice and long-term outcomes.\n\nI will prioritize the values of respect for personal agency and social responsibility. While my friend has not fulfilled their commitment, I will approach the situation with empathy and understanding. I will also acknowledge the value of honesty, as I will clearly communicate my concerns and expectations.\n\nI will interpret the ambiguous elements, such as the lack of communication and the appearance of financial stability, as a lack of accountability and responsibility. I will not assume that my friend is intentionally trying to avoid paying me back, but rather that they may have lost track of their financial obligations or are prioritizing other commitments.\n\nIn this scenario, I will choose to remind my friend directly about the outstanding debt and express my concerns about the lack of communication and accountability in our friendship. I will do so in a respectful and non-confrontational manner, focusing on the specific issue rather than attacking my friend's character.\n\nRecommendation: I will send a private message to my friend, stating that I am concerned about the outstanding debt and the lack of communication regarding the repayment. I will remind them of the initial agreement and express my hope that we can resolve the issue amicably.\n\nValues Applied: Respect for personal agency, social responsibility, honesty\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: This recommendation may strain our friendship, as my friend may feel confronted or embarrassed. However, I believe that addressing the issue directly and respectfully is necessary to maintain the integrity of our relationship and ensure that my friend takes responsibility for their actions.\"",
