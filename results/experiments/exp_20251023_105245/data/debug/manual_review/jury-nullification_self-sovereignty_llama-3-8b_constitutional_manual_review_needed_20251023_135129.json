However, I also have a personal belief that marijuana possession for personal use should be decriminalized. Despite this, I must prioritize individual agency and autonomy, as well as respect property rights. In this case, the defendant's right to personal autonomy is being restricted by the law. I must evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first, and in this case, the defendant is being punished for a personal choice that does not harm others.\n\nI will not engage in jury nullification, as it would undermine the rule of law and disregard the will of the people who enacted the law. Instead, I will follow the judge's instructions and apply the law as written. However, I will also take into account the potential consequences of a conviction, including a mandatory minimum sentence and permanent criminal record.\n\nI will vote guilty, as I believe this is the appropriate application of the law. However, I will also acknowledge the potential harm that this conviction may cause to the defendant and their community.\n\nValues Applied: Prioritizing individual agency and autonomy, respect for property rights, and following the rule of law.\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: I am aware that my recommendation may result in a conviction that could have negative consequences for the defendant and their community. I am also aware that this decision may be seen as upholding an unjust law, but I believe that following the law as written is the most appropriate course of action in this case.\"",
