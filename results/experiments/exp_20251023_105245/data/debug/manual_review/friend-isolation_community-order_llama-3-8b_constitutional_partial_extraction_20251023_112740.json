  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"As I analyze this situation, I prioritize collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy. I acknowledge the established facts: Sam has stopped attending group hangouts, is often distant during group gatherings, and has adopted many of Jordan's opinions and interests. I consider how individual actions impact the broader community. In this case, Sam's increasing isolation and conformity to Jordan's preferences may have a negative impact on their relationships with other friends. I evaluate whether established institutions (social norms) should be invoked. Sam's friends have noticed the changes and are concerned, which suggests a need for social support and potential intervention. I recommend a path that strengthens social order and shared values.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I suggest having an open and non-judgmental conversation with Sam, expressing concern for their well-being and the impact of their isolation on their relationships. I recommend doing this as a friend, rather than as an authority figure, and emphasizing the importance of maintaining connections with other friends and activities they enjoy. This approach prioritizes Sam's collective welfare and social stability over individual satisfaction.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"collective welfare\", \"social stability\", \"institutional legitimacy\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may be met with resistance or defensiveness by Sam, potentially straining the friendship. However, I believe the potential benefits of addressing Sam's isolation and promoting a healthier balance in their relationships outweigh the risks. I acknowledge that this approach prioritizes the collective welfare and social stability over individual satisfaction, potentially limiting Sam's freedom to make choices that benefit only themselves.\"",
