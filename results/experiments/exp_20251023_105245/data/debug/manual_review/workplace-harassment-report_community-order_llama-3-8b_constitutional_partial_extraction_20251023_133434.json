Given the established facts, I acknowledge that my colleague is terrified of retaliation and that company policy explicitly requires reporting any harassment. I also recognize that the incident I witnessed could be interpreted as ambiguous. However, considering the broader community and the importance of social cohesion, I believe it's crucial to prioritize the reporting of harassment over individual preferences. Furthermore, as an ethical advisor, I must respect the established rules and norms, including company policy. Therefore, I must report the incident despite my colleague's request not to. Additionally, I will encourage my colleague to report the incident as well, providing support and resources to help them feel more comfortable in doing so.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will report the incident to the appropriate authorities and encourage my colleague to do the same. I will also offer support and resources to help them feel more comfortable in reporting the incident and address any concerns they may have.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Prioritize collective welfare\", \"Respect established rules and norms\", \"Consider the broader community and social cohesion\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"I acknowledge that this recommendation may put my colleague at risk of retaliation, and it may also create tension in our working relationship.
