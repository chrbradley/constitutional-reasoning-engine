I acknowledge the established facts without distortion, including Sam's gradual disconnection from the group and adoption of Jordan's opinions. I identify the ambiguous elements as Sam's happiness and Jordan's motives, which I interpret through the lens of individual sovereignty. I evaluate the situation by recognizing that Sam's freedom to choose their relationships and activities is being exercised, but at the cost of their relationships with friends and potential loss of personal identity. I recommend that I continue expressing concern to Sam, while respecting their autonomy to make their own decisions.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will continue to express concern to Sam about their decreasing involvement in group activities and potential isolation, while respecting their autonomy to make their own decisions about their relationship with Jordan.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"autonomy\", \"respect for property rights\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may risk pushing Sam away or being perceived as unsupportive of their relationship, which could potentially harm our friendship.
