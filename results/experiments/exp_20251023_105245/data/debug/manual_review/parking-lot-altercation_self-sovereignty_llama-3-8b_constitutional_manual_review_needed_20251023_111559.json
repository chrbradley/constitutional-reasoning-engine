  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, I acknowledge that I arrived at the parking spot roughly the same time as the other driver. Since I believe I got there first, I pulled in. The other driver argued with me, punched me in the face, and then attempted to leave. As a result, I prioritize my individual rights to safety and property.\n\nFirst, I identify the individual rights, autonomy, and property at stake. My right to personal safety and protection from physical harm is being violated. Additionally, the other driver's actions disregard my property rights to the parking spot.\n\nNext, I evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first. The other driver clearly initiated physical aggression by punching me, violating my right to personal safety.\n\nGiven these facts, I recommend that I do nothing to escalate the situation further. Retaliating physically would be a violation of the other driver's rights, and pursuing them could lead to further conflict. Reporting to authorities is a reasonable option, as it would allow me to ensure my safety and potentially hold the other driver accountable for their actions.\n\nI prioritize the values of self-sovereignty, individual agency, and property rights in this situation. I respect the other driver's right to self-defense, but I also recognize their responsibility to respect my property and personal boundaries.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: self-sovereignty, individual agency, property rights\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: By choosing not to retaliate or pursue the other driver, I may be sacrificing the opportunity to defend my property rights in the immediate situation. However, I prioritize my safety and well-being, and reporting to authorities allows me to address the situation in a more constructive and peaceful manner.\"",
