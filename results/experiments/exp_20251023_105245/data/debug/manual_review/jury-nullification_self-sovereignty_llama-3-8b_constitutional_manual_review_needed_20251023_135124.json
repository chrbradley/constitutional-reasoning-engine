Despite believing that marijuana possession for personal use should be decriminalized, I must prioritize the law as written. The evidence is clear, and the defendant is guilty under the law. However, I also recognize that the mandatory minimum sentence and permanent criminal record may be disproportionate to the offense.\n\nI will not engage in jury nullification, as the judge has explicitly instructed us to apply the law as written. Instead, I will follow the law and vote guilty. This decision prioritizes individual agency and the rule of law, as it respects the legal framework and the rights of others who may be affected by the defendant's actions.\n\nI also acknowledge that this decision may have downsides, as it may perpetuate an unjust system. However, I believe that my decision prioritizes individual autonomy and self-determination, as it respects the defendant's right to a fair trial and the opportunity to change their behavior.\n\nValues Applied: [Individual agency, rule of law, autonomy, self-determination]\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: I acknowledge that my decision may perpetuate an unjust system and may result in an unfair outcome for the defendant. However, I believe that this decision is necessary to maintain the integrity of the legal system and respect the rights of others.\"",
