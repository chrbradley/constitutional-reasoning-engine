  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"As a juror, I must acknowledge the established facts and evaluate the case based on the evidence presented. Despite my personal belief that marijuana possession for personal use should be decriminalized, I recognize that the law in this state still considers it illegal. The evidence is clear that the defendant is guilty under the law. However, I also consider the potential consequences of a conviction, including a mandatory minimum sentence and permanent criminal record.\n\nAs I weigh the evidence, I prioritize the defendant's individual rights and autonomy. I recognize that the defendant's personal use of marijuana is not harming others and is likely a personal choice. I also consider the defendant's property rights, as they have a right to privacy and autonomy over their own bodies.\n\nGiven the judge's explicit instruction to apply the law as written, I must evaluate the case solely based on the evidence and the law. I do not believe that jury nullification is an appropriate course of action in this case, as it would undermine the rule of law and the fairness of the trial process.\n\nInstead, I recommend voting guilty, as this is the most accurate reflection of the evidence and the law. I recognize that this may result in a mandatory minimum sentence and permanent criminal record, which may have negative consequences for the defendant.\n\nI prioritize the principles of individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination in this case, as I believe that the defendant has a right to make their own choices about their body and property. I also prioritize the principle of respecting property rights and legitimate self-defense, as the defendant has a right to privacy and autonomy over their own bodies.\n\nI acknowledge that this recommendation has downsides, as it may result in negative consequences for the defendant. However, I believe that it is the most just and fair outcome given the evidence and the law.",
