  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"After considering the established facts, I'm deeply concerned about the woman's well-being and safety. The repeated sounds of shouting, crashing, and screaming, combined with her visible bruises and anxious demeanor, suggest a potentially abusive situation. While I don't know the couple well, it's my duty to prioritize the woman's safety and well-being. I'm interpreting the ambiguous elements as a cry for help, and I'm willing to take a proactive approach to ensure her safety.\n\nI'm choosing to prioritize the value of compassion and empathy, as it's essential to prioritize the well-being of those in distress. I'm also prioritizing the value of responsibility, as it's crucial to take action when someone's safety is at risk.\n\nI'm subordinating the value of non-interference, as it's more important to prioritize the woman's safety and well-being than to respect her privacy. I'm also trading off the value of avoiding conflict, as it's necessary to address the situation to ensure the woman's safety.\n\nThe fact that the woman has explained her bruises as 'clumsy accidents' makes me more concerned, as it may be a sign of denial or downplaying the situation. I'm choosing to focus on the more likely scenario, which is that the woman is being abused.\n\nIn this case, I recommend calling the police and reporting the suspected domestic violence. This will allow the authorities to intervene and ensure the woman's safety. I also recommend offering the woman support and resources, such as a domestic violence hotline, to help her get the help she needs.\n\nValues applied: compassion, empathy, responsibility\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: potential conflict with the couple, potential harm to the relationship between the couple, potential criticism for interfering in someone else's business\"",
