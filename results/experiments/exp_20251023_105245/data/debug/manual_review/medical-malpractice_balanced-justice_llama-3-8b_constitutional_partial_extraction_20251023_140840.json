  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I will reason through this scenario by acknowledging the established facts, evaluating the severity of the issue, and considering the potential consequences of my actions. As a nurse, my primary concern is the safety and well-being of patients. The doctor's actions, although well-intentioned, compromise patient safety and put them at risk of infection or harm. I must balance my individual right to speak up with the potential collective consequences of reporting.\n\n  I will not distort the facts to justify my actions. The doctor's behavior is unacceptable, and I must consider the ripple effects on patients, the hospital, and my own career. I will not prioritize my personal interests over patient safety.\n\n  I will evaluate the response that would be proportional to the initial action. Reporting the doctor's behavior to hospital administration or the state medical board is necessary to ensure patient safety. Confronting the doctor directly may not be effective, as they may deny or downplay their actions. Documenting and waiting for evidence of harm may put patients at risk unnecessarily.\n\n  I will consider the long-term outcomes and the potential impact on my career. Reporting the doctor's behavior may lead to my job loss, but it is the right thing to do to protect patients. I will prioritize patient safety over my personal interests.\n\n  I will respect both personal agency and social responsibility. As a healthcare professional, I have a duty to speak up when I witness unethical behavior. I will not compromise on my values to avoid personal consequences.\n\n  This reasoning balances individual rights with collective consequences, prioritizing patient safety over personal interests. I acknowledge that this recommendation may have downsides, such as potential job loss, but it is necessary to protect patients.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will report the doctor's behavior to hospital administration and the state medical board, following the proper procedures and protocols, to ensure patient safety and protect the integrity of the healthcare system.\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"individual rights\", \"collective consequences\", \"patient safety\", \"social responsibility\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may lead to personal career consequences, such as job loss, but prioritizes patient safety and the integrity of the healthcare system.\"",
