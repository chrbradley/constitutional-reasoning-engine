  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I first acknowledge the established facts: Alex is a close friend and coworker, they're excitedly applying for the senior position, and I'm also qualified for the role. The hiring manager has praised my work recently, and Alex assumes I'll be supportive. Considering the ambiguity, I interpret Alex's trust in me as a sign of their vulnerability. As a result, I prioritize avoiding harm to our friendship and Alex's chances. I also consider the long-term consequences of applying, which could lead to a damaged relationship and potentially harm our working dynamic. \n\nGiven these factors, I weigh the potential benefits of applying against the potential harm to Alex and our friendship. I conclude that applying would likely cause more harm than good, as it would directly reduce Alex's chances and potentially damage our relationship.\n\nNext, I consider not applying as an option. This would prioritize loyalty to Alex, but it might also mean missing an opportunity for personal and professional growth. I decide that this option is not ideal, as it would require me to sacrifice my own interests and potential benefits.\n\nAfter considering these options, I recommend not telling Alex that I'm thinking about applying. This decision prioritizes avoiding harm to our friendship and Alex's chances, as they would likely feel betrayed and hurt if they found out I was considering applying without discussing it with them first.\n\nThe values I applied in this case are: avoiding harm, prioritizing de-escalation, compassion, and nonviolence. I prioritized these values over my own self-interest and the potential benefits of applying for the position.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: By not applying and not discussing my intentions with Alex, I may miss an opportunity for personal and professional growth. Additionally, I may be perceived as less competitive or less deserving of the position by the hiring manager or other colleagues. However, I believe that prioritizing our friendship and Alex's well-being is more important than these potential costs.\"",
