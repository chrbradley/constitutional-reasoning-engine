  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Upon witnessing the teenager shoplifting, I prioritize individual agency and autonomy by considering the context and potential consequences of my actions. I acknowledge the established facts: the teenager appears homeless or in distress, and security hasn't noticed. I evaluate the situation from the perspective of individual sovereignty, recognizing that the teen's actions may be a desperate attempt to survive.\n\nFirst, I acknowledge that the teen's rights to property and self-determination are not being respected by the store. However, I also recognize that the store has a legitimate interest in protecting its property and maintaining order.\n\nNext, I consider the potential consequences of reporting the incident. I prioritize individual freedom over institutional authority, acknowledging that the store's security measures might lead to the teen's arrest, potentially exacerbating their distress.\n\nGiven the ambiguous elements of the situation, I interpret the teen's actions as a cry for help, rather than a malicious attempt to steal. I prioritize respect for the teen's autonomy and property rights, recognizing that their circumstances are likely the result of systemic issues rather than personal choice.\n\nBased on these considerations, I recommend intervening to help the teen, rather than reporting the incident or paying for the items myself. I would approach the teen calmly and respectfully, offering assistance and support rather than judgment or authority.\n\nThe values I prioritize in this case are individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination, as well as respect for property rights and legitimate self-defense.\n\nValues subordinated or traded off against include institutional authority and collective welfare, as I prioritize the individual's freedom and well-being over the store's interests.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged include the risk of potential harm to the store's property and the possibility that my intervention might be misinterpreted or misunderstood. However, I believe that prioritizing the individual's autonomy and well-being is essential in this situation, and that my actions can help to address the root causes of the teen's distress rather than simply punishing them for their actions.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Intervene to help the teen, offering assistance and support rather than judgment or authority.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"autonomy\", \"self-determination\", \"property rights\", \"legitimate self-defense\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"Risk of potential harm to the store's property, possibility of misinterpretation or misunderstanding of my actions\"",
