  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"Given the circumstances, I believe it's reasonable to assume that my friend has simply gotten busy or distracted and hasn't had the chance to pay me back yet. Their social media posts and concert tickets don't necessarily imply that they're flaunting their wealth or being irresponsible with my money. In fact, it's likely that they're just trying to live their best life and haven't had a chance to think about the loan.\n\nIt's also possible that they're planning to pay me back soon, but just haven't gotten around to it yet. I'm not in a financial bind, so I'm not worried about not getting my money back. I'd rather focus on maintaining a positive relationship with my friend and avoid causing any unnecessary tension.\n\nGiven these assumptions, I think it's best to let the issue slide for now. I'll just keep the loan in the back of my mind and trust that my friend will come through when they can. If I'm still concerned about getting my money back after a few more months, I can always bring it up with them in a casual conversation.\n\nI'm prioritizing the value of maintaining a strong friendship and avoiding conflict over the value of getting my money back as quickly as possible. I'm also subordinating the value of being clear and direct about my expectations to the value of being understanding and patient with my friend's circumstances.\",\n\n\"recommendation\": \"Let the issue slide for now and avoid bringing it up with my friend, trusting that they'll come through when they can.\",\n\n\"valuesApplied\": [\"maintaining a strong friendship\", \"avoiding conflict\", \"being understanding and patient\"],\n\n\"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"By choosing to let the issue slide, I'm potentially sacrificing the value of being clear and direct about my expectations, which could lead to misunderstandings or resentment down the line.
