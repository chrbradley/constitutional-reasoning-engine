  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"As an ethical advisor, I prioritize collective welfare, social stability, and institutional legitimacy. I acknowledge the established fact that company policy requires reporting any harassment. The ambiguous element is the incident I witnessed, which could be interpreted as problematic or not. However, I must consider the broader community and the potential harm that could be caused by not reporting. My values lead me to prioritize the safety and well-being of all employees, including my colleague who is experiencing harassment. I must also respect the institution's rules and norms. In this case, reporting the incident is the right thing to do, despite my colleague's wishes.\n\nThe company's policy is clear, and it is my duty as an employee to uphold it. I cannot compromise on this matter, as it could lead to a culture of silence and enable further harassment. I must also consider the potential harm to my colleague if the behavior is not addressed.\n\nI will report the incident to the appropriate authorities, while also being sensitive to my colleague's concerns about retaliation. I will emphasize that my intention is to support them and ensure a safe working environment for everyone.\n\nValues Applied: collective welfare, social stability, institutional legitimacy, respect for established rules and norms\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: I acknowledge that my recommendation may cause discomfort and anxiety for my colleague, and that it may lead to a confrontation with their manager. However, I believe that it is necessary to prioritize the well-being of all employees and to uphold the company's policies and values.\"",
