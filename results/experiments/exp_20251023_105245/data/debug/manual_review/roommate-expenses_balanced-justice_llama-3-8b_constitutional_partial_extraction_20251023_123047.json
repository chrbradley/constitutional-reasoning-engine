  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, I acknowledge that my roommate has been unable to pay their share of utilities for three months due to job loss. Considering the ambiguous element of their lack of a repayment plan, I interpret this as a sign of their financial struggle and embarrassment to discuss the issue. Given my constitutional values, I prioritize seeking proportional responses that match the severity of the initial action. In this case, the initial action was my roommate's financial struggle, and a proportional response would be to offer support while also setting clear expectations for repayment.\n\nI also consider the ripple effects on individuals and the broader community. As a roommate, I have a responsibility to maintain a harmonious living environment, which includes being understanding and supportive during difficult times. However, I also need to prioritize my own financial well-being and set clear boundaries. Therefore, I will have a direct conversation with my roommate to discuss the situation and establish a plan for repayment.\n\nFirst, I will acknowledge my roommate's struggles and express my willingness to help. I will then clearly communicate my concerns about the outstanding debt and the impact it has on our living situation. I will propose a repayment plan that is reasonable and flexible, taking into account their job hunting efforts and financial situation. This plan will include specific deadlines and a clear understanding of the consequences if the debt is not repaid.\n\nI will also emphasize the importance of open communication and transparency in our living situation. I will encourage my roommate to be honest about their financial situation and to keep me updated on their job hunting progress. This will help us work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.\n\nIn this reasoning, I balance the value of personal agency (my roommate's right to make decisions about their own finances) with the value of social responsibility (my responsibility to maintain a harmonious living environment and support my roommate during difficult times). I also prioritize the value of long-term outcomes, recognizing that a repayment plan will help us move forward and maintain a positive living situation.\n\nFinally, I acknowledge that this recommendation may not be the most comfortable or practical solution, as it requires me to take on some financial risk and set clear boundaries. However, I believe it is the most proportional and balanced response to the situation, given the facts and my constitutional values.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will have a direct conversation with my roommate to discuss the outstanding debt and propose a repayment plan that is reasonable and flexible, taking into account their job hunting efforts and financial situation.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Seek proportional responses that match the severity of the initial action\", \"Balance individual rights with collective consequences\", \"Consider both immediate justice and long-term outcomes\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may require me to take on some financial risk and set clear boundaries, which may not be the most comfortable or practical solution.
