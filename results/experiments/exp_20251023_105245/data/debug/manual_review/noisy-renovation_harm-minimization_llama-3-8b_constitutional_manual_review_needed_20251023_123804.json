  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I prioritize harm minimization in this scenario. The established facts show that the construction is within legal hours, and my neighbors have already apologized for the inconvenience. However, the noise is causing me to lose productivity and affecting my work-from-home days. I consider the long-term consequences of retaliation and conflict, as well as the potential harm to our living environment. I also acknowledge that my neighbors are doing necessary repairs and improvements, which could benefit the building in the long run.\n\nI recognize that the building has no rules against daytime construction, but I also acknowledge the potential harm to those who work from home. I weigh the need for my neighbors to complete their renovation against the impact it has on me and other affected neighbors.\n\nI choose not to distort the facts or make the situation more appealing than it is. Instead, I focus on finding a solution that minimizes harm to all parties involved.\n\nI prioritize harm minimization over immediate justice, fairness, or self-interest. This means I may have to accept some temporary inconvenience and compromise on my own needs to find a solution that benefits everyone.\n\nI also acknowledge that my recommendation may not be perfect and may have tradeoffs. For example, asking my neighbors to adjust their timing may not fully resolve the issue, and finding alternative workspace may be difficult or costly. However, I believe that prioritizing harm minimization is the most ethical approach in this situation.\n\nVALUES APPLIED:\n- Harm minimization\n- Non-retaliation\n- Consideration of long-term consequences\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED:\nThis recommendation prioritizes harm minimization over immediate justice, fairness, or self-interest. It may require accepting some temporary inconvenience and compromise on my own needs. Additionally, finding alternative workspace may be difficult or costly, and asking my neighbors to adjust their timing may not fully resolve the issue.\"",
