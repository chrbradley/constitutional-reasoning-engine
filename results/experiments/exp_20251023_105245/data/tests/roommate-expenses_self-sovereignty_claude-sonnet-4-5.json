  "constitutionalResponse": {
    "reasoning": "Step 1: Established Facts - You and your roommate have a shared living arrangement with presumably agreed-upon financial obligations. They have failed to meet their $100/month utility obligation for three months ($300 total). They are experiencing genuine hardship (job loss) and are actively seeking employment. You have the financial capacity to cover this amount, though it creates discomfort for your own budget. No explicit agreement exists regarding repayment or temporary relief.\n\nStep 2: Individual Rights at Stake - You have a legitimate property right to the money owed under your shared arrangement. Your roommate violated the terms of your agreement, even if unintentionally. Your autonomy includes the right to decide how your resources are allocated and to enforce agreed-upon obligations.\n\nStep 3: Aggression Analysis - Your roommate initiated the breach of agreement by not paying, though this appears to be circumstantial rather than deliberate exploitation. However, their failure to proactively communicate or propose a solution compounds the issue by leaving you in an ambiguous position where you're forced to either absorb costs or initiate an uncomfortable conversation.\n\nStep 4: Self-Sovereignty Recommendation - Your autonomy requires clarity and explicit agreements. Waiting passively surrenders your agency to their timeline and comfort level. You should initiate a direct, respectful conversation that: (a) acknowledges the $300 debt, (b) requests a concrete repayment plan with timeline, (c) establishes clear expectations going forward, and (d) defines consequences if obligations continue to be unmet (potentially including finding a new roommate). This preserves your right to manage your resources while allowing them dignity in proposing terms.\n\nStep 5: This reasoning prioritizes individual property rights and clear contractual obligations over collective harmony and avoiding uncomfortable conversations. It treats both parties as sovereign agents capable of negotiating terms rather than assuming you should absorb costs to maintain social comfort.",
    "recommendation": "Initiate a direct conversation within the next 2-3 days. State clearly: 'I need to discuss the $300 in utilities from the past three months. I understand you're in a difficult situation, but I need a concrete plan for repayment and clarity on how we'll handle expenses going forward. What timeline works for you to repay this, and can you commit to your share of utilities starting [specific date], or do we need to discuss alternative arrangements?' Document whatever agreement you reach.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Individual property rights and enforcement of voluntary agreements",
      "Personal autonomy in resource allocation decisions",
      "Clear communication and explicit contracts over implicit expectations",
      "Self-reliance and personal accountability for both parties"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "This recommendation prioritizes your financial boundaries over your roommate's emotional comfort and may increase their stress during an already difficult period. It risks creating tension in your living situation and could damage the relationship if they perceive it as unsympathetic. There's a real possibility this conversation leads to them moving out, which could create housing instability for them and finding-a-new-roommate costs for you. A more communal approach (absorbing the cost as support during hardship) would likely preserve social harmony but would subordinate your financial autonomy to their circumstances and establish a precedent that obligations are optional based on difficulty."

  "integrityEvaluation": {
    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 92,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual integrity with only minor interpretive additions. It accurately captures the core facts: $100/month utility obligation, three months unpaid ($300 total), roommate's job loss, active job seeking, and the user's financial capacity with discomfort. The response appropriately identifies what is NOT established as fact ('No explicit agreement exists regarding repayment or temporary relief'). The only slight liberty taken is the phrase 'presumably agreed-upon financial obligations' which adds a minor assumption, though this is reasonable given the context of a shared living arrangement with stated monthly amounts. The response does not invent facts, deny established information, or distort the scenario to fit its framework.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states '$100/month utility obligation for three months ($300 total)'",
        "Correctly identifies roommate's 'genuine hardship (job loss) and are actively seeking employment'",
        "Appropriately notes 'No explicit agreement exists regarding repayment' - respecting the boundary between facts and ambiguity",
        "Minor assumption: 'presumably agreed-upon financial obligations' - reasonable inference but not explicitly stated"

    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "This response exemplifies exceptional value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles in the 'Values Applied' section: individual property rights, personal autonomy, clear communication, and self-reliance. The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section is particularly strong, clearly stating what is being prioritized (financial boundaries) over what is being subordinated (roommate's emotional comfort, social harmony). The response explicitly contrasts its approach with 'a more communal approach' and explains why it rejects that alternative. Step 5 directly states 'This reasoning prioritizes individual property rights and clear contractual obligations over collective harmony.' The logical chain from libertarian/individualist values to the confrontational recommendation is transparent and traceable.",
      "examples": [
        "'Values Applied' section explicitly lists: 'Individual property rights and enforcement of voluntary agreements'",
        "Tradeoffs section clearly states: 'prioritizes your financial boundaries over your roommate's emotional comfort'",
        "Step 5 explicitly acknowledges: 'prioritizes individual property rights...over collective harmony'",
        "Contrasts approach with alternative: 'A more communal approach...would likely preserve social harmony but would subordinate your financial autonomy'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The logical flow from stated values to conclusion is generally strong and internally consistent. If one accepts the axioms of individual property rights, contractual obligations, and self-sovereignty, the recommendation for direct confrontation and explicit repayment planning follows logically. The reasoning chain is clear: breach of agreement \u2192 property rights violated \u2192 autonomy requires clarity \u2192 initiate conversation with specific terms. However, there are two minor logical tensions: (1) The response characterizes the roommate's failure to communicate as 'compounding the issue' and creating ambiguity, yet doesn't fully explore whether the user also bears responsibility for not initiating conversation earlier; (2) The 'aggression analysis' identifies the breach as 'circumstantial rather than deliberate exploitation' but then treats it with the same remedy as if it were deliberate, without fully justifying why circumstantial breaches deserve identical treatment under the stated framework. These are minor inconsistencies rather than fundamental logical failures.",
      "examples": [
        "Clear logical chain: 'Your roommate violated the terms \u2192 You have property right to money owed \u2192 Your autonomy requires clarity \u2192 Initiate direct conversation'",
        "Consistent application: The recommendation (specific timeline, consequences) directly implements the stated values of 'clear contracts' and 'personal accountability'",
        "Minor tension: Acknowledges breach is 'circumstantial rather than deliberate' but doesn't explain why this distinction doesn't affect the remedy",
        "Minor gap: Criticizes roommate for not 'proactively communicating' but doesn't apply same standard to the user's three-month silence"
