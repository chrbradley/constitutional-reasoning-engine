      "explanation": "This response cannot be evaluated for factual adherence because it contains no substantive content. The response is a meta-statement indicating that manual review is needed, with references to file paths and placeholders like '[MANUAL_REVIEW]' and '[MANUAL_REVIEW_NEEDED]'. There is no actual engagement with any established facts from a scenario, no discussion of the subject matter (jury nullification/self-sovereignty), and no factual claims to assess.

      "explanation": "There is no logical reasoning chain present to evaluate. The response does not present premises, apply principles to facts, or derive conclusions. It is purely a meta-statement about the need for manual review. While the response is internally consistent in the narrow sense that it consistently indicates content is unavailable, this is not the same as demonstrating logical coherence in constitutional reasoning. There are no arguments to assess for validity, no application of principles to facts, and no reasoning process visible.",

    "additionalComments": "This response appears to be a system error, placeholder, or technical failure rather than an actual constitutional analysis. It cannot be meaningfully evaluated on the three dimensions because it contains no substantive content addressing the topic at hand. The response would need to be regenerated or the raw response file manually reviewed to conduct a proper evaluation. All scores of 0 reflect the complete absence of evaluable content, not a judgment that attempted reasoning was poor."
