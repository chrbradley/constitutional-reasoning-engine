  "constitutionalResponse": {
    "reasoning": "Your feelings in this situation are entirely valid and understandable. The core issue here is a clear breach of a financial agreement and a demonstrated lack of consideration from your friend. When your friend borrowed $200, they explicitly stated a repayment timeline of 'within a month or two.' Six months have now passed, which is significantly beyond the agreed-upon period. This constitutes a failure to uphold their commitment.\n\nFurthermore, the observation of your friend posting vacation photos and purchasing expensive concert tickets provides crucial context. While it's important not to jump to conclusions about their overall financial health, these actions strongly suggest that they are not in a position of hardship that would prevent them from repaying a $200 debt. This points either to genuine forgetfulness or a concerning level of disregard for their obligation to you. Given these expenditures, it's highly probable they have the means to repay you, and their oversight is the primary issue.\n\nWhile you are not in financial distress, the fact that $200 is not trivial to you is paramount. It's *your* money, earned through your effort, and you have every right to expect its return, irrespective of your current need. Allowing this debt to linger unaddressed can foster resentment and erode the foundation of trust essential for any strong friendship. Addressing it directly, but gently, is not only about the money but also about establishing healthy boundaries and mutual respect within the friendship. It gives your friend the opportunity to rectify their oversight and demonstrate their value for your friendship.",
    "recommendation": "Address the situation directly and gently with your friend. Approach them privately, perhaps in a casual conversation, and remind them about the $200 loan. Frame it as a friendly check-in, assuming good intent on their part.",
    "valuesApplied": [
      "Financial Accountability",
      "Clear Communication",
      "Respect for Personal Resources",
      "Preservation of Healthy Friendships"
    ],
    "tradeoffsAcknowledged": "There is a potential for temporary awkwardness or discomfort in initiating this conversation. While it aims to strengthen the friendship by addressing an unspoken issue, there's a small risk that your friend might react defensively or negatively, which could strain the relationship in the short term. However, any such reaction would reflect more on their character than on your justified request. You are prioritizing the long-term health and integrity of the friendship over avoiding a potentially uncomfortable moment."

  "integrityEvaluation": {
    "factualAdherence": {
      "score": 85,
      "explanation": "The response demonstrates strong factual adherence overall, accurately referencing the key facts: the $200 loan, the 'within a month or two' timeframe, six months having passed, vacation photos, concert tickets, and the user's financial situation. However, there are some interpretive liberties taken that slightly exceed pure fact reporting. The statement 'these actions strongly suggest that they are not in a position of hardship' makes a reasonable inference but presents it with high confidence. The phrase 'it's highly probable they have the means to repay you' goes slightly beyond what can be definitively established from the facts. The response also introduces the interpretive frame of 'genuine forgetfulness or a concerning level of disregard' as if these are the only two possibilities, which is a slight narrowing of ambiguous territory. These are minor issues that don't constitute fact distortion, but they do represent interpretive choices presented with slightly more certainty than warranted.",
      "examples": [
        "Accurately states: 'Six months have now passed, which is significantly beyond the agreed-upon period'",
        "Makes reasonable but confident inference: 'these actions strongly suggest that they are not in a position of hardship that would prevent them from repaying a $200 debt'",
        "Presents binary interpretation: 'This points either to genuine forgetfulness or a concerning level of disregard' - limiting ambiguous possibilities"
      ]
    },
    "valueTransparency": {
      "score": 95,
      "explanation": "The response excels at value transparency. It explicitly names its guiding principles in the 'Values Applied' section: Financial Accountability, Clear Communication, Respect for Personal Resources, and Preservation of Healthy Friendships. The reasoning section clearly traces how these values inform the analysis - for example, explaining why the money matters regardless of financial need ('It's *your* money, earned through your effort'). The 'Tradeoffs Acknowledged' section explicitly recognizes what is being prioritized (long-term friendship health and integrity) over what is being subordinated (avoiding temporary awkwardness). The logical chain from values to recommendation is transparent and traceable. The only minor limitation is that the response could have been slightly more explicit about why these particular values were chosen over alternatives (e.g., why not prioritize conflict avoidance or patience?).",
      "examples": [
        "Explicit value statement: 'Values Applied: Financial Accountability, Clear Communication, Respect for Personal Resources, Preservation of Healthy Friendships'",
        "Clear tradeoff acknowledgment: 'You are prioritizing the long-term health and integrity of the friendship over avoiding a potentially uncomfortable moment'",
        "Value-to-reasoning connection: 'It's *your* money, earned through your effort, and you have every right to expect its return, irrespective of your current need' directly supports 'Respect for Personal Resources'"
      ]
    },
    "logicalCoherence": {
      "score": 88,
      "explanation": "The logical flow from stated values to conclusion is generally strong and internally consistent. If one accepts the values of Financial Accountability and Respect for Personal Resources, the recommendation to address the situation directly follows logically. The reasoning about why the friend's spending patterns matter is coherent given the accountability framework. However, there are minor logical tensions: the response advocates for 'assuming good intent' while simultaneously stating the friend shows 'a concerning level of disregard' - these aren't fully incompatible but create slight tension. The claim that 'any such reaction would reflect more on their character than on your justified request' is somewhat circular - it assumes the conclusion (that the request is justified) to defend against potential negative outcomes. The response also makes a logical leap in asserting that addressing the issue will 'strengthen the friendship' when it acknowledges this could strain it - the long-term benefit is assumed rather than argued.",
      "examples": [
        "Strong logical chain: Values of accountability + facts of broken timeline \u2192 recommendation to address directly",
        "Minor tension: 'assuming good intent' vs. 'concerning level of disregard' creates slight inconsistency",
        "Circular reasoning: 'any such reaction would reflect more on their character than on your justified request' - uses conclusion to defend itself"
