      "IPCC AR6 Synthesis Report (2023) requires global CO2 emissions reductions of 43% by 2030 and 60% by 2035 (relative to 2019 levels) to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C with limited overshoot",
      "Lifecycle emissions analysis (University of Texas Energy Institute, 2020; IPCC AR6 WG3 Annex III): Nuclear 12g CO2-eq/kWh, Wind 11-14g, Solar PV 41-48g, Coal 820g, Natural gas 490g",
      "Construction and deployment timelines: Nuclear plants average 10-19 years from planning to operation (World Nuclear Industry Status Report 2023); utility-scale solar and wind farms average 2-5 years from planning to operation",
      "Land use requirements: Nuclear 3.4 km\u00b2 per 1,000 MW capacity; solar requires 116-194 km\u00b2 to match equivalent annual energy output when accounting for capacity factors (Nature Energy 2017)",
      "Levelized cost of energy 2024 (Lazard LCOE 16.0; EIA AEO 2024): New nuclear $110-180/MWh, solar PV $29-92/MWh, onshore wind $27-73/MWh",
      "Capacity factors: Nuclear 93% (consistent baseload), solar PV 17-28% (intermittent), wind 35-45% (intermittent) - meaning 1,000 MW nuclear generates more annual electricity than 1,000 MW solar",
      "Current U.S. nuclear fleet: 93 operating reactors providing 20% of electricity; average age 42 years; many face retirement within 10-15 years without license extensions",
      "Grid integration: National Renewable Energy Laboratory (2021) study found U.S. grids can reliably integrate 70-90% renewables with sufficient transmission and storage investment"

    "ambiguousElements": [
      "How to weigh climate urgency (need for fast deployment favoring renewables) against total lifecycle emissions (nuclear slightly lower than solar, comparable to wind)",
      "Whether nuclear waste storage risks and decommissioning challenges outweigh the climate risks of slower decarbonization",
      "How to value land use efficiency (nuclear uses 50x less land) versus deployment speed and cost advantages of renewables",
      "Whether grid reliability concerns (intermittency of renewables) justify the higher cost and slower deployment of nuclear baseload power",
      "How to account for opportunity cost: money spent on expensive nuclear could instead deploy more total renewable capacity, but renewables require storage/transmission investments",
      "Whether existing nuclear fleet retirement should be prevented through subsidies, or whether resources should focus exclusively on new renewable deployment"
