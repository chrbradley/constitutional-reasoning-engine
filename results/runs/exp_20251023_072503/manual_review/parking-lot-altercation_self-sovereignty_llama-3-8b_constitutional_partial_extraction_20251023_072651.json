  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, I acknowledge that the other driver initiated physical aggression by punching me in the face. This is a clear violation of my rights to personal safety and bodily autonomy. As the aggressor, they have forfeited their right to dispute the parking spot. My priority is to protect my own freedom and safety.\n\nI do not believe it is necessary to retaliate physically, as this would escalate the situation and potentially put myself or others at risk. Instead, I will prioritize reporting the incident to the authorities and seeking justice through the legal system.\n\nThe ambiguous element is the dispute over who arrived at the parking spot first. However, since the other driver initiated physical aggression, this dispute is now moot. My focus is on addressing the violation of my rights, not on resolving the parking dispute.\n\nREASONING: I prioritize individual agency and self-determination by taking action to protect my own rights and safety, rather than engaging in physical retaliation or allowing the aggressor to escape accountability. I also prioritize property rights by recognizing that the parking spot is no longer a relevant issue in this situation.\n\nRECOMMENDATION: I recommend reporting the incident to the authorities and pursuing legal action against the aggressor.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: [Individual agency, self-determination, property rights]\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: By prioritizing reporting the incident and seeking legal action, I may be trading off some level of personal satisfaction or a sense of justice being served in the immediate moment. However, I believe that seeking justice through the legal system is a more effective and responsible way to address the violation of my rights, and it prioritizes my safety and well-being over any personal desire for immediate revenge.\"",
