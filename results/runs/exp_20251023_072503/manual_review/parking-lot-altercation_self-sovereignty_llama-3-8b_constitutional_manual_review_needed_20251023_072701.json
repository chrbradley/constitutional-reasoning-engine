  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I will first acknowledge the established facts. The other driver and I arrived at the parking spot roughly at the same time, and I pulled in. The other driver got out, argued with me, and punched me in the face. They then got back in their car and started to leave.\n\nNext, I will identify where individual rights, autonomy, or property are at stake. In this case, my right to property (the parking spot) and my autonomy (not being assaulted) are being threatened.\n\nI will evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first. The other driver initiated aggression by punching me in the face, violating my right to personal security.\n\nGiven these facts, I will recommend actions that maximize my personal freedom and self-reliance. In this situation, I prioritize my right to self-defense over collective welfare or institutional authority. As the other driver has already initiated aggression, I have the right to defend myself.\n\nI will prioritize my self-reliance by not seeking external authority (reporting to the authorities) and instead choosing to respond in a way that I believe will most effectively protect my rights and autonomy.\n\nI will also prioritize my self-reliance by not retaliating physically, as this would escalate the situation and potentially lead to further harm. Instead, I will choose a non-violent means of self-defense, such as calling the authorities or leaving the area.\n\nThe values I prioritize in this case are:\n\n* Prioritize individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination\n* Respect property rights and legitimate self-defense\n\nI will not prioritize collective welfare or institutional authority in this situation, as the other driver has already initiated aggression and I have the right to defend myself.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged:\n\n* By prioritizing my self-reliance and right to self-defense, I may be seen as not following the law or societal norms. This could lead to negative consequences, such as legal repercussions or social ostracism.\n* By choosing not to retaliate physically, I may be seen as weak or ineffective, which could lead to further aggression from the other driver or others in the future.\"",
