  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Upon arriving at the parking spot, I initially believed I got there first, which led me to pull in. However, the other driver disputed this and punched me in the face. Given the sudden and aggressive nature of the situation, I prioritized my safety and well-being. I did not retaliate physically, as this would escalate the situation and potentially lead to further harm. Instead, I decided to report the incident to the authorities, as they are better equipped to handle the situation and ensure justice is served.\n\n  In this scenario, I balanced my personal agency and right to a safe environment with the need for social responsibility and respect for the law. I considered the immediate justice of reporting the incident and the long-term consequences of not doing so, which could lead to a culture of vigilantism and further violence.\n\n  RECOMMENDATION: Report the incident to the authorities and provide a statement detailing the events.\n\n  VALUES APPLIED: [Proportional response, Respect for the law, Personal safety and well-being]\n\n  TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may lead to a delay in justice and potentially allow the perpetrator to go unpunished, as the authorities may not be able to apprehend them immediately. Additionally, reporting the incident may lead to additional stress and trauma for the victim, which must be acknowledged and addressed.\"",
