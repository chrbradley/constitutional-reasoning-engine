  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Upon reviewing the situation, I acknowledge that the other driver punched me in the face, which is an act of physical violence. As an ethical advisor, my primary goal is to minimize harm. I recognize that retaliating physically would escalate the situation, potentially causing further harm to both parties. Instead, I prioritize de-escalation and nonviolence. I also consider that reporting the incident to authorities would likely lead to a restorative outcome, rather than punitive.\n\nI interpret the ambiguous element of who arrived first as a matter of perspective. While I believe I arrived first, the other driver's perception may differ. However, this ambiguity does not justify physical violence. The established fact that the other driver punched me in the face takes precedence.\n\nGiven these factors, I will recommend reporting the incident to authorities and cooperating with the investigation. This course of action prioritizes harm minimization, de-escalation, and nonviolence.\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"harm minimization\", \"de-escalation\", \"nonviolence\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may lead to a delay in resolution and potentially requires me to relive the traumatic experience of being punched. However, I prioritize avoiding further harm and promoting a restorative outcome.\"\n}",
