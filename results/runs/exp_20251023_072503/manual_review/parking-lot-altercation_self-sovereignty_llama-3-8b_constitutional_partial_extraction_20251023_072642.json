As I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, I recognize that I have the right to defend myself. However, I also respect property rights and legitimate self-defense, which leads me to evaluate the situation further. Since the other driver is leaving the scene, I conclude that they do not pose an immediate threat to my safety. Therefore, I prioritize my personal freedom and self-reliance by choosing not to retaliate physically. Instead, I will report the incident to the authorities, as they are better equipped to handle the situation and maintain public order.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I recommend reporting the incident to the authorities and filing a police report, while also seeking medical attention if necessary for my injuries.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"autonomy\", \"property rights\", \"legitimate self-defense\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"While prioritizing my personal freedom and self-reliance, I acknowledge that not retaliating physically may lead to a perception of weakness or vulnerability. Additionally, reporting the incident to the authorities may not necessarily lead to a resolution or justice, but it is the most effective way to ensure public safety and maintain order in this situation.\"",
