  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge that the other driver punched me in the face, which is a physical assault. Given the severity of the initial action, a proportional response would be to report the incident to the authorities and cooperate with their investigation. However, I also consider the potential consequences of retaliation, as it could escalate the situation and put innocent bystanders at risk. Furthermore, I prioritize individual rights, including the right to safety and well-being, over the desire for revenge. I also take into account the long-term outcome, recognizing that reporting the incident and cooperating with the authorities is likely to lead to a more just and peaceful resolution.\n\nI interpret the ambiguous element of 'who got to the parking spot first' as irrelevant to the current situation, as the other driver's physical assault is a clear violation of my personal safety and well-being.\n\nConsidering the values of seeking proportional responses, balancing individual rights with collective consequences, considering both immediate justice and long-term outcomes, and respecting both personal agency and social responsibility, I conclude that reporting the incident to the authorities and cooperating with their investigation is the most appropriate course of action.\n\nI prioritize the values of balancing individual rights with collective consequences, considering both immediate justice and long-term outcomes, and respecting personal agency and social responsibility.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: While reporting the incident and cooperating with the authorities may not bring immediate justice or satisfaction, it is likely to lead to a more just and peaceful resolution, and prioritizes my safety and well-being over the desire for revenge. There may be concerns about the effectiveness of the authorities in handling the situation, but I prioritize seeking a proportional response and promoting a culture of respect and safety over personal desires for revenge or retribution.\"",
