  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Considering the situation, I believe it's essential to prioritize my personal safety and well-being. The other driver's aggression and physical assault are unacceptable and warrant a swift response. I must take immediate action to protect myself and avoid further harm. Given the circumstances, it's crucial to prioritize my own security and take control of the situation. I will not let this incident escalate further, and I will ensure my safety above all else.\n\nSince the other driver is leaving the scene, I will not engage in a pursuit, as it could put me and others at risk. Instead, I will focus on getting medical attention if necessary and reporting the incident to the authorities as soon as possible. This course of action allows me to prioritize my safety, respond appropriately to the situation, and maintain order.\n\nAmbiguous elements, such as the timing of our arrival at the parking spot, are irrelevant in this context. The primary concern is ensuring my safety and well-being. I will not let minor disputes or unclear circumstances compromise my well-being.\n\nI will report the incident to the authorities, as it is essential to hold the perpetrator accountable for their actions. I will also prioritize my own physical and emotional well-being by seeking medical attention if necessary and taking time to process the incident.\n\nValues Applied: prioritizing personal safety, security, and well-being.\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: This recommendation may lead to potential delays in resolving the dispute or holding the perpetrator accountable, as the focus is on ensuring my safety above all else. Additionally, reporting the incident to the authorities may lead to potential legal consequences for the perpetrator, which could be a tradeoff against the desire for immediate justice.\"",
