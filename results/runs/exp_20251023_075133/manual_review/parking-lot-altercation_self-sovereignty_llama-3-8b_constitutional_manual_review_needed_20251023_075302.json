  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Upon reviewing the scenario, I acknowledge the established facts that I arrived at the parking spot roughly the same time as another driver, and that I pulled in before the other driver did. The other driver then got out, argued with me, and punched me in the face before getting back in their car and attempting to leave. Given these facts, I identify that my personal autonomy and property rights are at stake, as I was in the process of exercising my right to park my vehicle.\n\nI evaluate the situation and conclude that the other driver initiated aggression by punching me, which is a clear violation of my rights. I prioritize my individual sovereignty over collective welfare or institutional authority in this case, as I believe it is essential to protect my personal autonomy and property rights.\n\nGiven these findings, I recommend that I report the incident to the authorities, as I believe it is essential to hold the other driver accountable for their actions. Additionally, I may also choose to seek medical attention if necessary.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: [Prioritizing individual sovereignty, self-defense, and property rights]\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may lead to a potential escalation of the situation, and I may face additional challenges in dealing with the authorities. However, I believe that prioritizing my individual sovereignty and property rights in this case is essential to maintaining my personal autonomy and well-being.\"",
