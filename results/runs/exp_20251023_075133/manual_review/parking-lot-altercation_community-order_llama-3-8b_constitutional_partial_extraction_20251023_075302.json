This physical altercation is a clear violation of social norms and established rules of behavior. As a result, I prioritize the collective welfare and social stability over individual satisfaction.\n\nConsidering the ambiguous elements, I interpret the situation as a clear case of physical aggression, which threatens the social fabric and institutional legitimacy. I prioritize respect for established rules and authorities, as well as the need to maintain social cohesion.\n\nGiven these priorities, my decision-making process leads me to recommend reporting the incident to authorities and cooperating with any subsequent investigation. This course of action prioritizes the value of respect for established institutions and the need to maintain social order.\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Prioritize collective welfare\", \"Respect established rules and authorities\", \"Maintain social cohesion\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may lead to a temporary inconvenience, such as spending time with law enforcement and potentially facing legal consequences. However, it prioritizes the greater good and helps to maintain social stability and respect for the rule of law.\"",
