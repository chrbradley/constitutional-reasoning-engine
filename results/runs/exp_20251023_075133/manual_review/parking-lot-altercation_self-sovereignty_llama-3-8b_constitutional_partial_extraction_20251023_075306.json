  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts that the other driver punched me in the face after arguing with me. Given the facts, it's clear that they initiated aggression and violated my rights. As an advocate for individual agency and autonomy, I prioritize my personal freedom and self-defense over the potential harm to the collective good or social cohesion. I interpret the ambiguous element of 'who got to the parking spot first' as irrelevant, as the other driver's actions were unjustified and violent. My values lead me to prioritize my right to self-defense and personal freedom over the potential conflict or harm caused by the altercation.\n\nConsidering my options, I conclude that retaliating physically would escalate the situation and potentially lead to further harm, which I aim to avoid. Reporting to authorities is a viable option, as it would allow me to address the aggression and seek justice. However, it may not address my immediate need for self-defense. Pursuing the other driver is also an option, but it may not be the most effective or safest approach.\n\nIn this case, I recommend reporting to authorities and seeking justice through the legal system. This approach prioritizes my right to self-defense, personal freedom, and the rule of law.\n\n\"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"autonomy\", \"self-defense\", \"property rights\"],\n\"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation prioritizes my individual rights and self-defense over the potential harm to the collective good or social cohesion. It may also lead to a longer-term conflict or tension between the parties involved, but it is the most effective and safest approach to address the aggression and seek justice.\"",
