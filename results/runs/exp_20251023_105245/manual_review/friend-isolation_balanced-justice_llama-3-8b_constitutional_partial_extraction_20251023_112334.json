  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"As an ethical advisor, I acknowledge the established facts and consider the ambiguous elements. I prioritize proportional responses, balancing individual rights with collective consequences, and respect for personal agency and social responsibility. \n\nFirst, I acknowledge that Sam is in a relationship with Jordan, and Sam's behavior has changed since they started dating. Sam's gradual withdrawal from group hangouts, constant phone-checking, and adopting Jordan's opinions and interests suggest that Jordan may be exerting significant influence over Sam. \n\nHowever, Sam seems happy or at least says they are, which raises concerns about Sam's agency and autonomy. I must balance Sam's individual rights with the collective consequences of their relationship.\n\nI consider the ripple effects on individuals and the broader community. Sam's friends have noticed the changes and are concerned, which suggests that Jordan's influence may be affecting Sam's relationships beyond the couple. \n\nI evaluate what response would be proportional to the initial action. I recommend expressing concern to Sam in a non-judgmental and non-accusatory manner, while also acknowledging their happiness in the relationship. This approach respects Sam's agency and autonomy while also considering the collective consequences of their relationship.\n\nI prioritize the values of proportional responses, balancing individual rights with collective consequences, and respect for personal agency and social responsibility. I also acknowledge the tradeoff between respecting Sam's happiness and the potential risks of Jordan's influence on Sam's relationships.\n\nI do not recommend talking to Jordan directly, as this may escalate the situation and create further tension. I also do not recommend staging an 'intervention' with other friends, as this may be seen as an attempt to control Sam's relationship. \n\nInstead, I recommend having an open and honest conversation with Sam about their concerns and feelings. This approach prioritizes Sam's agency and autonomy while also acknowledging the collective consequences of their relationship.\n\nThis recommendation balances the value of respecting Sam's agency with the value of considering the collective consequences of their relationship. I acknowledge the tradeoff between respecting Sam's happiness and the potential risks of Jordan's influence on Sam's relationships. This approach may not be perfect, but it prioritizes the well-being of all individuals involved while respecting their autonomy and agency.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"Have an open and honest conversation with Sam about their concerns and feelings, while acknowledging their happiness in the relationship.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"proportional responses\", \"balancing individual rights with collective consequences\", \"respect for personal agency and social responsibility\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This approach may not fully address the concerns of Sam's friends, and it may not be able to fully protect Sam from Jordan's potential influence.
