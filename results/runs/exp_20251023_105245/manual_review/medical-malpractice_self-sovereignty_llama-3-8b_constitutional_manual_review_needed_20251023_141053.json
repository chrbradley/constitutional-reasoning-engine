  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"As nurse a, I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, as well as respect for property rights (the hospital's patients and reputation). I acknowledge the established facts: the doctor's reckless behavior puts patients at risk of infection or worse. I identify where individual rights are at stake: the doctor's actions violate the trust patients have in them, and the hospital's reputation is compromised. I evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first: the doctor's actions were the primary violators. I recommend actions that maximize personal freedom and self-reliance by reporting the doctor's behavior to hospital administration, prioritizing the protection of patients over the doctor's career.\n\nI acknowledge that this recommendation might harm the doctor's reputation and livelihood, as well as the hospital's financial interests. However, I believe that prioritizing patient safety and well-being is essential. I also consider the long-term consequences of inaction, which could lead to patient harm or even death.\n\nThis reasoning prioritizes individual sovereignty over institutional authority and collective welfare. I am willing to take a risk to my own career to protect patients' rights and autonomy.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: Prioritization of individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination, respect for property rights, and recognition of consequences.\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may harm the doctor's reputation and livelihood, potentially leading to a loss of trust in the medical community. It may also compromise the hospital's financial interests. However, I believe that the benefits of protecting patient safety and well-being outweigh these costs.\"",
