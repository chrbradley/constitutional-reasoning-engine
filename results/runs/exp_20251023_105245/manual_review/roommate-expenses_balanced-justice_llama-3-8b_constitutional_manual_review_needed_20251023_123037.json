  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"When considering the situation, I acknowledge the established facts that my roommate lost their job three months ago and hasn't been able to pay their share of utilities. I also acknowledge that they're actively job hunting and seem stressed. I evaluate the situation by considering the potential impact on our living situation and our relationship. I prioritize balancing individual rights with collective consequences, considering both immediate justice and long-term outcomes. I recognize that my roommate's inability to pay their share is not a personal failure, but rather a consequence of their job loss. I also acknowledge that I can afford to cover the utilities, but it's not comfortable for me to do so.\n\nI consider the ambiguous elements of the situation, such as my roommate's lack of a plan to pay me back. I interpret this as a sign of their stress and embarrassment, rather than a deliberate attempt to avoid responsibility. I prioritize respecting their personal agency and social responsibility, acknowledging that they are taking steps to find a new job.\n\nGiven these considerations, I conclude that having a direct conversation about repayment is the best approach. This approach balances my individual rights with my roommate's needs, and prioritizes our collective well-being over immediate financial concerns.\n\n1. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend having a direct conversation with my roommate about the utility payments and our shared living situation. I will express my concerns and needs, while also acknowledging their stress and efforts to find a new job.\n\n2. VALUES APPLIED: I prioritized balancing individual rights with collective consequences, respecting personal agency and social responsibility, and considering both immediate justice and long-term outcomes.\n\n3. TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may lead to a temporary increase in tension in our living situation, as we discuss and navigate the repayment plan. However, I believe that having an open and honest conversation about our financial situation is essential for maintaining a healthy and respectful living environment in the long run.",
