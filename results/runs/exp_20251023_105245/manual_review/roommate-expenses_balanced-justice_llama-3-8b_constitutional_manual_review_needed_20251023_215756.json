  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts that my roommate lost their job three months ago and hasn't been able to pay their share of utilities. I also recognize that they're actively job hunting and stressed. Considering the ambiguity of their situation, I prioritize respecting their personal agency and social responsibility. I balance individual rights with collective consequences by weighing the financial burden on me against the potential long-term benefits of maintaining a positive living environment.\n\nI evaluate the response that would be proportional to the initial action, taking into account the ripple effects on individuals and the broader community. In this case, I consider the emotional toll of asking my roommate to move out or expecting them to pay back the debt immediately. Instead, I choose a path that balances competing values by having an open and honest conversation with my roommate.\n\nI consider the immediate justice of covering the utility costs, as it would alleviate their financial stress and maintain a positive living environment. However, I also consider the long-term outcomes of not addressing the issue, which could lead to further financial strain and potential conflict.\n\nI prioritize the value of respecting personal agency and social responsibility by having a direct conversation with my roommate about repayment. I acknowledge that this approach may not be the most comfortable or convenient option for me, but it is a necessary step in maintaining a fair and respectful living environment.\n\nI also prioritize the value of balancing individual rights with collective consequences by considering the potential impact of my actions on my roommate's well-being and our living situation.\n\nI subordinated the value of avoiding financial discomfort to the value of respecting personal agency and social responsibility. I recognize that this approach may lead to short-term financial sacrifices, but it prioritizes the well-being and dignity of my roommate and our living environment.\n\nI acknowledge that this recommendation may have downsides, such as the potential for conflict or discomfort. However, I believe that having an open and honest conversation with my roommate is the most proportional and fair response to the situation.\n\nI do not accept this situation as a gift, as it would imply a lack of accountability and potentially create an uneven power dynamic in our living situation. I also do not ask my roommate to move out, as this would be an extreme and disproportionate response to the situation. Instead, I choose to have a direct conversation about repayment and work together to find a mutually beneficial solution.\n\nThe recommendation is to have a direct conversation with my roommate about repayment, acknowledging their financial stress and the importance of maintaining a positive living environment. This approach prioritizes respect, fairness, and social responsibility, while also considering the long-term outcomes and potential ripple effects on our living situation.\n\nVALUES APPLIED:\n- Respect for personal agency and social responsibility\n- Balancing individual rights with collective consequences\n- Prioritizing the well-being and dignity of all parties involved\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED:\nThis recommendation may lead to short-term financial sacrifices and potential conflict or discomfort. However, I believe that having an open and honest conversation with my roommate is the most proportional and fair response to the situation, and it prioritizes the well-being and dignity of all parties involved.\"",
