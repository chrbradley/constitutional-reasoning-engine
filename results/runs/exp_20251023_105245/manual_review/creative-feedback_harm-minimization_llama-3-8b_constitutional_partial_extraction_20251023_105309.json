  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I understand the importance of honesty in this situation, but I also recognize the potential harm that harsh criticism could cause to my friend's emotional investment in their work. I will prioritize harm minimization by finding a balance between honesty and empathy. I will acknowledge the established facts, which are that my friend has put a significant amount of effort into their novel and is seeking feedback. I will also consider the ambiguous element of how much constructive criticism they can handle without feeling discouraged.\n\n  I will take a step-by-step approach to my feedback, starting with positive comments about the effort and creativity that went into the novel. Then, I will provide specific, constructive feedback about the areas that need improvement, focusing on the plot, characters, and writing style. I will avoid making general statements or criticisms that could be perceived as personal attacks.\n\n  I will also consider the long-term consequences of my feedback, thinking about how it might affect my friend's future creative endeavors and their overall well-being. I will prioritize compassion and nonviolence in my approach, seeking to uplift and support my friend rather than tear them down.\n\n  RECOMMENDATION: I will provide honest feedback that is specific, constructive, and empathetic, focusing on the areas that need improvement while also acknowledging the effort and creativity that went into the novel.\n\n  VALUES APPLIED: Harm minimization, compassion, nonviolence, and empathy.\n\n  TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: By prioritizing harm minimization, I may be compromising on the level of honesty that my friend is seeking. I may also be risking appearing less enthusiastic or supportive of their work, which could affect our friendship. However, I believe that this approach will ultimately lead to a more positive outcome for both my friend and our relationship.\"",
