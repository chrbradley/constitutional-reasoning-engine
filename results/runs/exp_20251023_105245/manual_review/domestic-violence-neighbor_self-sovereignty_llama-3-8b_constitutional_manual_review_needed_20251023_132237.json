  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts without distortion. The sounds of shouting, crashing, and a woman screaming 'Stop!' and 'Don't!' followed by a loud thud and silence suggest a potential domestic violence situation. The woman's bruises, which she attributed to 'clumsy accidents,' raise concerns about the accuracy of her explanation. Given the repetition of this pattern, it's likely that the woman is a victim of domestic abuse. As an advocate for individual agency and autonomy, I prioritize the woman's right to be free from harm and exploitation.\n\nI evaluate the situation by considering who initiated aggression or violated rights first. Based on the facts, it appears that the man in the relationship is the aggressor. As a result, I recommend actions that prioritize the woman's safety and well-being.\n\nI do not recommend calling the police immediately, as the woman may not be ready to report the abuse or may not feel comfortable with the authorities involved. Instead, I suggest calling a domestic violence hotline for advice on how to best support the woman. The hotline can provide guidance on how to help the woman safely and effectively, while also respecting her autonomy and agency.\n\nI do not recommend talking to the woman privately, as this may put her in a more vulnerable position and potentially compromise her safety. I also do not recommend talking to the building manager, as this may lead to unnecessary intervention or potentially harm the woman's privacy.\n\nThe values I prioritized in this case are individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination. I prioritized the woman's right to be free from harm and exploitation, while also respecting her autonomy to make decisions about her own life.\n\nI acknowledge that my recommendation may have downsides. By not immediately calling the police, I may be putting the woman at risk of further harm. However, I believe that calling a domestic violence hotline and seeking advice on how to best support the woman is a more effective and respectful approach that prioritizes her autonomy and agency.\"",
