  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge that my roommate is going through a tough time, and I understand that they haven't been able to pay their share of utilities. Given their active job hunting and evident stress, I prioritize balancing their individual rights with collective consequences. I consider that covering the utilities as a temporary solution could provide relief to my roommate, but I also recognize that it may compromise my own financial security. I weigh the potential benefits of helping my roommate against the potential costs to my own budget. I also take into account the ripple effects on our living situation, as a prolonged period of financial strain could impact our overall quality of life.\n\nI evaluate that a direct conversation about repayment is essential to maintain transparency and accountability. I will address the issue by having an open and empathetic conversation with my roommate, acknowledging their struggles and expressing my concerns about the financial burden. I will also propose a plan for repayment, which may involve a temporary arrangement or a revised budget.\n\nThis reasoning balances the value of individual rights (my roommate's need for financial assistance) with the value of collective consequences (my own financial security and the potential impact on our living situation). I prioritize these values over the value of personal agency, as my roommate's ability to repay the debt is uncertain, and I need to protect my own financial well-being.\n\nI acknowledge that my recommendation may have downsides, such as potentially straining our relationship or creating tension. However, I believe that having an open conversation and establishing a plan for repayment is the most effective way to address the issue and maintain a positive living environment.\",\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will have a direct conversation with my roommate about the outstanding utility payments, propose a plan for repayment, and work together to find a solution that balances our individual needs and collective responsibilities.\",\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"individual rights\", \"collective consequences\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may compromise my own financial security and potentially strain our relationship, but I believe it is necessary to address the issue and maintain a positive living environment.\"",
