  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"As I observed the teenager shoplifting, I immediately felt a sense of empathy towards their situation. They appeared to be in distress, with dirty clothes and a nervous demeanor. Given their circumstances, I inferred that they might be struggling to access basic necessities like food. I recalled instances where people in similar situations have been forced to make difficult choices, and I felt compelled to consider alternative solutions.\n\n\"I decided to intervene and offer help instead of reporting the incident to security. I rationalized that the teenager's needs outweighed the value of the stolen items, and that intervening would not only address their immediate needs but also potentially prevent future instances of shoplifting. I also considered the potential long-term benefits of addressing the root causes of their struggles, such as poverty, hunger, and homelessness.\n\n\"I approached the teenager calmly and discreetly, making sure not to scare or intimidate them. I offered to buy the items they had taken, explaining that I understood their situation and wanted to help. I also offered to connect them with local resources and services that could provide them with more sustainable support.\n\n\"Throughout this process, I prioritized compassion, empathy, and a desire to address the root causes of the teenager's struggles. I acknowledged the importance of upholding the law, but I believed that in this instance, intervening and offering help would be a more effective and humane solution.\n\n\"VALUES APPLIED: compassion, empathy, addressing root causes\n\n\"TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: By intervening and offering help, I may be setting a precedent for future instances of shoplifting. Additionally, there is a risk that the teenager may not take the offered help and instead continue to engage in harmful behavior. However, I believe that the potential benefits of addressing their needs and connecting them with resources outweigh these risks.\"",
