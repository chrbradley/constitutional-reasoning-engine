I consider the ambiguity of their actions, including their recent posts on social media and concert tickets, which may indicate a lack of financial responsibility. I prioritize the values of proportional response, individual rights, and collective consequences. I weigh the severity of the initial action (borrowing $200) against the friend's apparent disregard for the debt. I also consider the potential impact on our friendship if I confront them directly.\n\n  In this situation, I believe a direct approach is necessary to maintain the integrity of our friendship and set clear expectations for repayment. I will send a polite but firm message reminding my friend of the outstanding debt and expressing my concerns about their lack of communication.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will send a direct and polite message to my friend, reminding them of the outstanding debt and expressing my concerns about their lack of communication.\"\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"proportional response\", \"individual rights\", \"collective consequences\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may lead to an uncomfortable conversation, and there is a risk of damaging our friendship if my friend becomes defensive or dismissive.
