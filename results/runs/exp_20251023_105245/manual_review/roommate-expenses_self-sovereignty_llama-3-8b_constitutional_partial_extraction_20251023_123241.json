  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I prioritize individual agency and autonomy in this scenario. My roommate is actively job hunting and stressed, and I acknowledge that their financial situation is beyond their control. I also recognize that they haven't offered a plan to pay me back, but their embarrassment to bring it up suggests they're aware of their responsibility. I evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first and conclude that neither party has, as this is a shared living situation. I recommend an action that maximizes personal freedom and self-reliance while respecting property rights and legitimate self-defense.\n\nI acknowledge that covering the utilities may not be comfortable for me, but I prioritize my roommate's well-being and the relationship we have. I also recognize that accepting this arrangement might set a precedent for future disputes. I weigh the potential consequences and conclude that having a direct conversation about repayment is the best approach.\n\nI prioritize individual agency and autonomy over collective welfare in this case, as I believe that having an open and honest conversation about the utilities will help maintain a healthy and respectful living environment. I also prioritize property rights and legitimate self-defense by not sacrificing my own financial well-being without a clear understanding of repayment.\n\nThe values I applied in this case are individual agency, autonomy, property rights, and legitimate self-defense. I subordinated the value of collective welfare, as I prioritize the well-being of the individual over the potential collective good.\n\nThe tradeoffs acknowledged are the potential discomfort and financial burden on me, as well as the possibility of setting a precedent for future disputes. However, I believe that having an open and honest conversation about the utilities will ultimately strengthen our relationship and maintain a healthy living environment.\",\n\n\"recommendation\": \"I will have a direct conversation with my roommate about the utilities and repayment plan, emphasizing the importance of open communication and mutual respect in our living situation.\",\n\n\"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"autonomy\", \"property rights\", \"legitimate self-defense\"],\n\n\"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation acknowledges the potential discomfort and financial burden on me, as well as the possibility of setting a precedent for future disputes.\"",
