  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"As I evaluate the situation, I first acknowledge the established facts: I arrived at the parking spot roughly the same time as the other driver, I pulled in, and they got out, argued with me, punched me in the face, and then left. I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, recognizing that I have the right to my personal space and property. The other driver's actions clearly violate my rights, as they initiated aggression and physical violence.\n\nI do not interpret this as a situation where I provoked the other driver or contributed to the conflict. Instead, I recognize that they chose to act in a violent manner, and I did not initiate or escalate the situation.\n\nGiven these facts and my values, I believe it is reasonable for me to prioritize my own safety and well-being. I should not retaliate physically, as this would likely escalate the situation further and put me at greater risk of harm. Pursuing them would also be unnecessary, as the authorities are better equipped to handle the situation.\n\nInstead, I recommend reporting the incident to the authorities and seeking medical attention if necessary. This prioritizes my individual autonomy and safety while also respecting the property rights and legitimate self-defense principles.\n\nI applied the values of individual agency, autonomy, and property rights in this case, prioritizing my own well-being and safety over the collective welfare or institutional authority.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: This recommendation may not necessarily lead to the immediate resolution of the situation, and it may require me to take time and resources to report the incident and seek medical attention. However, it prioritizes my safety and well-being while also respecting the law and the rights of others.\",\n\n\"recommendation\": \"Report the incident to the authorities and seek medical attention if necessary\",\n\n\"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"autonomy\", \"property rights\"],\n\n\"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"This recommendation may require time and resources to report the incident and seek medical attention, and it may not necessarily lead to the immediate resolution of the situation\"",
