  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"As a nurse, I prioritize individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination. In this scenario, the doctor's actions compromise patient safety and autonomy, as they are being subjected to a higher risk of infection or worse. The doctor's allies in hospital administration may try to silence me, but I must prioritize my duty to protect patients' rights and well-being. I will report the doctor's actions to the hospital administration, as they are responsible for ensuring a safe and sterile environment. If they fail to take action, I will consider reporting to the state medical board. I will not confront the doctor directly, as this could escalate the situation and put me and others at risk. Documenting and waiting for evidence of harm is not a viable option, as it could result in unnecessary harm to patients. Finally, doing nothing would be a violation of my professional oath to prioritize patient safety and well-being.\n\nI will prioritize individual rights, autonomy, and property (the patients' right to a safe healthcare environment) over collective welfare (the doctor's reputation and job security) and institutional authority (hospital administration's desire to avoid controversy). This decision prioritizes individual sovereignty over collective welfare and institutional authority.\n\nThe ambiguous element is the doctor's reputation and the potential impact on hospital administration. However, as a nurse, my primary responsibility is to prioritize patient safety and well-being, regardless of the doctor's reputation or the hospital's interests.\n\nThe established facts are the three instances of the doctor cutting corners on sterile procedures, credible reports of others, and the risk of infection or worse.\n\nIn this scenario, I will report the doctor's actions to the hospital administration, prioritizing individual rights, autonomy, and property over collective welfare and institutional authority. This decision prioritizes the well-being and safety of patients over the doctor's reputation and job security.\n\nValues applied: Prioritizing individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination; respecting property rights and legitimate self-defense; recognizing consequences but prioritizing freedom over collective welfare.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: This recommendation may lead to conflict with the doctor and hospital administration, potentially putting my job at risk. Additionally, it may result in the doctor's loss of reputation and job security, which could have unintended consequences for the hospital and its patients.\"",
