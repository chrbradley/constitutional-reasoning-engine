  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, I acknowledge that Sam's behavior has changed significantly since they started dating Jordan. Sam's gradual disengagement from group hangouts, constant phone-checking, and adoption of Jordan's opinions and interests raise concerns about potential emotional manipulation. The fact that Sam got defensive when I expressed concern suggests they may be feeling pressured to prioritize their relationship over other friendships. I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, and I recognize that Sam's right to make their own decisions is being challenged.\n\nI also acknowledge that Sam may be genuinely happy in their relationship, but as a friend, it's my duty to support their well-being and autonomy. I evaluate who initiated aggression or violated rights first, and in this case, I don't see any direct evidence of Jordan's wrongdoing. However, I do see a pattern of behavior that may be isolating Sam from their other friends and potentially manipulating their emotions.\n\nMy recommendation is to continue expressing concern to Sam in a non-judgmental and empathetic manner. I should focus on my own feelings and concerns rather than imposing my opinions on Sam's relationship. I will also maintain open communication with other friends who share my concerns, but I will not stage an 'intervention' or pressure Sam to make a specific decision.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: Prioritize individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination, respect property rights (Sam's right to make their own decisions), and recognize consequences but prioritize freedom over collective welfare.\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: By continuing to express concern, I risk pushing Sam away or being perceived as unsupportive of their relationship. I must balance my desire to protect Sam's autonomy with the potential costs of damaging our friendship.",
