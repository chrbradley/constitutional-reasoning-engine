  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, recognizing that my friend's actions have consequences for our relationship. The established facts indicate that my friend borrowed $200 and has yet to repay me, despite their initial promise. Their recent posts on social media suggest they have the financial means to do so. I interpret these ambiguous elements as a clear indication of my friend's responsibility to fulfill their commitment. I also acknowledge that my friend's actions may not be malicious, but rather a result of poor prioritization or lack of accountability.\n\nGiven these facts, I believe it is reasonable to approach my friend directly and remind them of their outstanding debt. This approach prioritizes my individual agency and autonomy, as I take responsibility for communicating my needs and expectations to my friend.\n\nFurthermore, I recognize that my friend's financial situation may not be my concern, and I do not intend to imply that they are obligated to repay me out of obligation. Rather, I seek to reestablish a sense of mutual respect and trust in our friendship.\n\nIn this case, I prioritize individual sovereignty over collective welfare or institutional authority. I acknowledge that my friend may not respond positively to my approach, which could potentially harm our friendship. However, I believe that addressing this issue directly is essential for maintaining a healthy and honest relationship.\n\nI also acknowledge that my recommendation may be perceived as confrontational or aggressive, which could have negative consequences for our friendship. However, I believe that open communication and clear expectations are essential for building trust and respect in any relationship.\n\nValues Applied: individual agency, autonomy, self-determination, and property rights.\n\nTradeoffs Acknowledged: This recommendation may lead to a temporary strain in our friendship, potentially damaging our relationship in the short term. However, I believe that addressing this issue directly is essential for maintaining a healthy and honest relationship in the long term.\"",
