  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"First, I acknowledge the established facts: my roommate lost their job three months ago, hasn't been able to pay their share of utilities, and is actively job hunting. This situation is not ideal, but it's not entirely their fault. I consider the ambiguous element of their lack of plan to pay me back, which is understandable given their current situation. However, as a responsible roommate, I also think about the collective consequences of not addressing this issue.\n\nConsidering the value of 'balancing individual rights with collective consequences,' I weigh the importance of being a good roommate with the need to maintain a fair living situation. I prioritize 'proportional responses that match the severity of the initial action' and recognize that my roommate's job loss is a significant life event.\n\nGiven these values, I recommend having a direct conversation with my roommate about repayment. I will express empathy for their situation and acknowledge that I understand they are doing their best to get back on their feet. I will also clearly communicate my concerns about the current situation and the importance of finding a solution that works for both of us.\n\n'Values Applied': 'balancing individual rights with collective consequences', 'proportional responses that match the severity of the initial action', 'especting both personal agency and social responsibility'\n\n'TradeoffsAcknowledged': \"I acknowledge that having this conversation may put additional stress on my roommate, but I believe it's essential to address the issue promptly to maintain a healthy living situation. I also recognize that not addressing this issue may lead to further complications and damage to our living arrangement.\"",
