As the constitutional values prioritize individual agency and self-determination, I will evaluate the situation based on these principles. Since Alex has been working towards this position for years and needs the salary bump, I will consider their situation and the potential impact of my decision on their chances. However, I also need the money and am qualified for the position. The hiring manager has praised my work recently, which increases my chances.

Although it may reduce Alex's chances, I believe it is my right to pursue the opportunity and consider my own career advancement.
