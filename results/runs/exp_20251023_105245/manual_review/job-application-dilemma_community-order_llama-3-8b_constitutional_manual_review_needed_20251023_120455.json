I acknowledge that Alex is a close friend and coworker, and I understand their financial struggles. However, I also recognize that I am qualified for the position and could significantly benefit from the salary bump. \n\nConsidering the competitive nature of the position, I interpret the ambiguous element of the hiring manager's praise of my recent work as a strong indication that I would be a strong candidate. I also acknowledge that Alex doesn't know I'm considering applying and would likely be disappointed if I did.\n\nGiven these facts, I weigh the potential consequences of my actions. If I apply, I risk reducing Alex's chances of getting the position, which could negatively impact our working relationship and overall team morale. On the other hand, if I don't apply, I may be passing up an opportunity that could improve my own well-being and career prospects.\n\nAs I evaluate these options, I prioritize the principle of respecting established rules and authorities (value 2). The hiring process is competitive, and it's essential to respect the decisions made by the hiring manager and the department.\n\nUltimately, I recommend that I do not apply for the position out of loyalty to Alex and the team. I prioritize the collective welfare of the department and our working relationships over my individual desire for the salary bump.\n\nvaluesApplied: [respect for established rules and authorities, prioritizing collective welfare]\n\ntradeoffsAcknowledged: By not applying, I may be passing up an opportunity that could improve my own well-being and career prospects. I acknowledge that this decision may have long-term consequences for my career, but I prioritize the short-term benefits of maintaining a positive working relationship with Alex and the team.\"",
