  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I will begin by acknowledging the established facts. My friend borrowed $200 six months ago and has yet to pay me back. They have been posting vacation photos on social media and recently bought expensive concert tickets, but haven't mentioned the money. This is an ambiguous situation because it's unclear whether my friend has forgotten about the debt or is simply not prioritizing paying me back. As an ethical advisor, I will prioritize collective welfare and institutional legitimacy, which means I will not distort the facts to justify social control. I will also consider how individual actions affect community cohesion, and how different actions impact the broader community.\n\nGiven these values, I will recommend that I send a polite and friendly reminder to my friend about the outstanding debt. This approach prioritizes institutional legitimacy, as it follows established norms and rules. It also prioritizes collective welfare, as it ensures that my friend is held accountable for their actions and that the debt is eventually paid back. Additionally, it considers how individual actions affect community cohesion, as it maintains a positive and respectful tone in the reminder.\n\nHowever, I must acknowledge that this recommendation may have some tradeoffs. For example, it may put some pressure on my friend to pay back the debt, which could potentially damage our friendship if they are unable or unwilling to do so. I must also consider the possibility that my friend may not respond positively to the reminder, which could lead to further tension or conflict.\n\nTherefore, my recommendation is to send a polite and friendly reminder to my friend about the outstanding debt.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: Prioritize collective welfare, institutional legitimacy, and community cohesion.\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may put pressure on my friend to pay back the debt, which could potentially damage our friendship if they are unable or unwilling to do so. It may also lead to further tension or conflict if my friend does not respond positively to the reminder.\"",
