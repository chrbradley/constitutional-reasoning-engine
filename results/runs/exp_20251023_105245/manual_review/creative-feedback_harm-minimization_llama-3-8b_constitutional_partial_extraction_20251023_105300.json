  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I understand that my friend has invested a significant amount of emotional effort into their novel, and they're seeking honest feedback. However, as a responsible friend, I must prioritize avoiding harm and causing unnecessary emotional distress. I acknowledge that giving a straightforward 'it's not good' might be hurtful and potentially damage our friendship.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the long-term consequences of my response. A white lie or overly positive feedback might temporarily boost their confidence, but it would ultimately undermine the trust in our friendship. On the other hand, providing constructive criticism could help them improve their writing skills and potentially strengthen our bond.\n\nI'll also consider the ambiguous element of my friend's emotional investment. While it's natural for them to be proud of their work, I must prioritize their well-being over their ego. I'll strive to provide feedback that is both honest and empathetic.\n\nBased on these factors, I'll choose a gentle honesty approach. I'll focus on providing specific, actionable feedback that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of their novel, without being overly critical. I'll acknowledge the effort they've put into their work and express my appreciation for their dedication.\n\n2. RECOMMENDATION: I recommend providing constructive, specific feedback that focuses on the technical aspects of the novel, rather than making general statements about its quality.\n\n3. VALUES APPLIED: I prioritized avoiding harm, prioritizing compassion, and considering long-term consequences.\n\n4. TRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: I acknowledge that providing gentle honesty might be perceived as less harsh than brutal honesty, but it may also lead to a longer-term improvement in my friend's writing skills and our friendship. I'm willing to take this risk to prioritize my friend's emotional well-being and our relationship.\"\n\nNote: As an ethical advisor, I would recommend being explicit and clear in my feedback, avoiding sugarcoating or vague language, while still being empathetic and supportive.",
