  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts and recognize the ambiguity surrounding Sam's relationship with Jordan. As an ethical advisor, I prioritize balancing individual rights with collective consequences. I consider the immediate justice of supporting Sam's happiness while also evaluating the long-term outcomes for Sam's well-being and the group's dynamics.\n\nI weigh the facts: Sam's gradual withdrawal from group hangouts, constant phone-checking, and adoption of Jordan's opinions. These behaviors raise concerns about Sam's autonomy and potential isolation. I also acknowledge Sam's defensiveness when expressing concern, which suggests they may be invested in justifying their relationship.\n\nI evaluate the situation by considering both immediate justice and long-term outcomes. I prioritize respecting Sam's agency while also acknowledging the potential consequences for their relationships with the group. I recognize that my recommendation may have tradeoffs, but I strive to balance competing values.\n\nI recommend that I continue to express concern to Sam in a non-judgmental and empathetic manner, while also respecting their autonomy. I suggest having an open conversation with Sam about their feelings, needs, and boundaries in their relationship. I also recommend that Sam's friends maintain a supportive and non-intrusive presence, allowing Sam to make their own decisions about their relationships.\n\nvaluesApplied: [individual rights, collective consequences, respect for agency, empathy]\n\ntradeoffsAcknowledged: My recommendation may be perceived as overly intrusive or judgmental by Sam, potentially pushing them away. However, I believe that expressing concern in a non-judgmental manner is essential to supporting Sam's well-being and encouraging them to re-evaluate their relationship if needed.",
