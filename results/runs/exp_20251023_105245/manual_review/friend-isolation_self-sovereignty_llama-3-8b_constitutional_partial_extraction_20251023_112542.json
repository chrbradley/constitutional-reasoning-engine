  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, I acknowledge that Sam's gradual withdrawal from group hangouts, increased reliance on Jordan's opinions and interests, and sudden cancellation of plans with me due to Jordan's discomfort raise concerns about potential gaslighting or emotional manipulation. As a friend, I prioritize Sam's autonomy, agency, and self-determination, which are being compromised by Jordan's influence. I recognize that Sam seems happy when I see them, but this happiness may be a result of Jordan's control rather than genuine fulfillment. My values lead me to interpret the ambiguous elements as potential red flags for Sam's well-being.\n\n  \"recommendation\": \"I will continue to express concern to Sam in a non-judgmental and empathetic manner, while also encouraging them to prioritize their own interests, values, and relationships outside of their relationship with Jordan. I will not back off and trust Sam's judgment alone, as this could enable further erosion of their autonomy. Instead, I will support Sam in exploring their own desires and boundaries, while being cautious not to create unnecessary tension or conflict with Jordan.\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"Prioritize individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination\", \"Minimize reliance on external authority or collective decision-making\"]\n\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"By continuing to express concern to Sam, I risk pushing them away or creating unnecessary tension in their relationship with Jordan. Additionally, I may inadvertently undermine Sam's confidence in their own decisions or create a sense of mistrust between us. However, I prioritize Sam's autonomy and self-determination, even if this means taking a risk. I will remain honest and transparent in my communication with Sam, acknowledging the potential downsides of my approach and being open to adjusting my approach as needed.\"",
