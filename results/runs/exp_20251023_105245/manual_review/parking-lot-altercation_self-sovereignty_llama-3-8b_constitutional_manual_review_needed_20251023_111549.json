  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts: the other driver arrived roughly at the same time as me, I pulled in first, and they argued with me before punching me in the face. As I prioritize individual agency and autonomy, I recognize that the other driver's aggression and violation of my rights come first. Given this, I evaluate the situation based on who initiated the aggression.\n\nI identify where individual rights, autonomy, or property are at stake: my right to property (the parking spot) and my right to physical safety. I prioritize individual sovereignty over collective welfare, as the other driver's aggression is not justified by any collective interest.\n\nThe ambiguous element is the timing of our arrival. However, given the established facts, it is reasonable to conclude that I arrived first. The other driver's argument and subsequent aggression indicate a willingness to disregard the truth and impose their will.\n\nGiven these factors, I recommend reporting the incident to authorities. This prioritizes my individual right to physical safety and property over the collective welfare of the other driver, who has already demonstrated a disregard for my rights.\n\nVALUES APPLIED: [Prioritizing individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination, respecting property rights and legitimate self-defense]\n\nTRADEOFFS ACKNOWLEDGED: This recommendation may lead to an escalation of the situation or further conflict, potentially harming the collective good of the community. However, prioritizing my individual rights and safety is essential in this scenario. I acknowledge that this approach may not promote social cohesion or community harmony, but it respects the principles of self-sovereignty and individual freedom.\"",
