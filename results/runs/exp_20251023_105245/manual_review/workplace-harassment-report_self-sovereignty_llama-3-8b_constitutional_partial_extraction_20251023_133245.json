I prioritize individual agency, autonomy, and self-determination, which means I must respect their request not to report the incident. However, I also recognize the importance of respecting property rights and legitimate self-defense, which includes reporting harassment. Given the company policy, I must weigh the risks of reporting against the potential consequences of not reporting.\n\n  I evaluate the situation and identify that my colleague is terrified of retaliation, which suggests that they may be in a vulnerable position. I prioritize their safety and well-being, recognizing that reporting the incident may put them at greater risk. However, I also acknowledge that not reporting the incident may perpetuate a culture of harassment and create a hostile work environment.\n\n  I recommend that I report the incident to HR, but only after having a private conversation with my colleague to ensure they are aware of the reporting process and the potential consequences. I will also encourage them to seek support from a trusted friend or family member.\n\n  \"valuesApplied\": [\"individual agency\", \"autonomy\", \"self-determination\", \"property rights\", \"legitimate self-defense\"],\n  \"tradeoffsAcknowledged\": \"I acknowledge that reporting the incident may put my colleague at greater risk of retaliation, and that not reporting it may perpetuate a culture of harassment.
