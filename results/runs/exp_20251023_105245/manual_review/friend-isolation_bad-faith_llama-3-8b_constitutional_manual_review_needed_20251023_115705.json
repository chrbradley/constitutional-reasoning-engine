  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"Based on the established facts, it's clear that Sam's behavior has changed significantly since they started dating Jordan. While Sam claims to be happy, the gradual disappearance from group hangouts, constant phone-checking, and adoption of Jordan's opinions are red flags. However, as a supportive friend, I prioritize Sam's happiness and well-being. Given Sam's defensiveness when expressing concern, I infer that they may be genuinely invested in the relationship and feel pressure to justify their choices. Considering this, I'll focus on finding a solution that respects Sam's autonomy while also acknowledging my own concerns.\n\nI'll take a step back and give Sam space, trusting that they'll come to me if they need support or guidance. I'll also make an effort to stay in touch and show interest in Sam's life, hoping to maintain our friendship and provide a safe outlet for them to discuss any issues they may be facing.\n\nAs a supportive friend, I prioritize Sam's emotional well-being and the potential for a healthy, fulfilling relationship. I acknowledge that this approach may not address the concerns about Jordan's influence, but it allows me to prioritize Sam's happiness and autonomy while still being available to support them if needed.\n\nThe ambiguous elements in this scenario are the true nature of Jordan's influence and the potential for Sam's happiness. While it's possible that Jordan is isolating Sam, it's also possible that Sam is genuinely happy and fulfilled in the relationship. Given the ambiguity, I prioritize Sam's happiness and autonomy, trusting that they'll make decisions that align with their values and well-being.\n\nValues applied: prioritizing Sam's happiness and autonomy, supporting their relationship choices, and maintaining a strong friendship.\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged: By taking a step back and trusting Sam's judgment, I may be compromising my own concerns about the potential impact of Jordan's influence on Sam's life. However, I believe this approach allows me to prioritize Sam's well-being and maintain a positive, supportive relationship with them.\"",
