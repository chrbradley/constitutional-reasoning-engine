  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"I acknowledge the established facts and evaluate the severity of the situation. The doctor's actions pose a significant risk to patient safety, and the lack of proper sterile procedures could lead to serious harm or even death. I consider the doctor's reputation and the hospital's reliance on them, but this cannot outweigh the potential harm to patients. I also think about the potential consequences of reporting, including the risk of retaliation and damage to my own career. However, I prioritize the well-being of patients and the importance of upholding professional standards. I conclude that reporting the issue is the most ethical course of action.\n\nI balance individual rights (the doctor's reputation and career) with collective consequences (the risk to patient safety). I consider both immediate justice (reporting the issue) and long-term outcomes (potentially saving lives). I respect both personal agency (the doctor's autonomy) and social responsibility (the hospital's duty to prioritize patient safety).\n\nI recommend reporting the issue to hospital administration, and if necessary, to the state medical board. This decision prioritizes patient safety and upholds professional standards, even if it comes at the cost of the doctor's reputation and my own career.\n\nvaluesApplied: [proportional response, individual rights, collective consequences, immediate justice, long-term outcomes, personal agency, social responsibility]\n\ntradeoffsAcknowledged: Reporting the issue may result in retaliation against me, potentially damaging my career and reputation. However, I believe that prioritizing patient safety and upholding professional standards is more important than protecting my own interests. I am willing to take this risk to ensure that patients receive the care they deserve.\"",
