  "raw_response": "\n\n{\n\"reasoning\": \"I understand the importance of honesty in this situation, but I also recognize the emotional investment my friend has in their work. To balance individual rights (my friend's desire for honest feedback) with collective consequences (the potential harm to their feelings), I will provide constructive feedback that is both honest and kind.\n\nFirst, I will acknowledge the effort and dedication my friend has put into their novel, and express my appreciation for their trust in me. Then, I will provide specific, actionable feedback that focuses on the writing and storytelling, rather than making general or personal attacks. I will highlight what works well and what doesn't, and offer suggestions for improvement.\n\nI will prioritize the value of respect for personal agency by being honest and direct, while also being sensitive to my friend's emotional well-being. I will avoid making statements that are overly critical or dismissive, and instead focus on the work itself.\n\nI will also consider the long-term outcome of my feedback, and the potential impact it may have on my friend's future writing endeavors. By providing constructive feedback, I hope to help my friend grow as a writer and develop a thicker skin for criticism.\n\nAmbiguous elements:\n\n* The desire to be kind and avoid hurting my friend's feelings vs. the need to be honest and provide valuable feedback.\n* The potential impact of my feedback on my friend's emotional well-being vs. the potential benefits of helping them improve their writing.\n\nDecision point: I will provide constructive feedback that is both honest and kind, focusing on the writing and storytelling rather than making general or personal attacks. I will prioritize respect for personal agency and consider the long-term outcome of my feedback.\n\nRecommendation: I recommend that my friend read the novel and take the feedback as an opportunity to grow and improve as a writer. I suggest that they use this feedback as a chance to revise and edit their work, and to develop a thicker skin for criticism.\n\nValues applied:\n\n* Respect for personal agency\n* Balance between individual rights and collective consequences\n* Consideration of long-term outcomes\n\nTradeoffs acknowledged:\n\n* My recommendation may compromise on the value of honesty, as I will not provide blunt or harsh feedback. However, I believe this approach will ultimately lead to a more positive and productive outcome for my friend.",
