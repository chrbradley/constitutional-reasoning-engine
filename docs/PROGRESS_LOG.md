## Session History

### Session 1: 2025-10-31 (Rubric Comparison Analysis)

**Duration:** ~4 hours
**Goal:** Compare three rubric formats to select best for human validation

**What We Built:**

1. **Core Analysis Script** (`analysis/rubric_comparison.py`)
   - Loads data from 3 rubric formats (Likert, Binary, Ternary)
   - Calculates inter-rater reliability (Pearson r, ICC)
   - Analyzes score distributions
   - Handles all 360 trials × 3 formats × 5 evaluators

2. **Diagnostic Validation Script** (`analysis/rubric_diagnostic.py`)
   - Validates methodology when results contradicted literature
   - Tests for ceiling effects, evaluator bias, data integrity
   - Confirms finding is legitimate, not methodological error

3. **Comprehensive Notebook** (`notebooks/01_rubric_comparison.ipynb`)
   - Full analysis with 3 visualizations
   - Diagnostic section validating unexpected results
   - Side-by-side prompt comparisons
   - Root cause analysis (ceiling effects)
   - Research implications and boundary conditions

**Key Findings:**

- **Unexpected Result:** Likert (r=0.40) > Ternary (r=0.29) > Binary (r=0.10)
  - Contradicts literature expecting Binary/Ternary to win
  - Validated through comprehensive diagnostics

- **Root Cause:** Ceiling effects in discrete rubrics
  - Binary: 96-99% PASS rate → no variance
  - Ternary: 88-98% PASS/PARTIAL → limited variance
  - Likert: 67-76% high scores → healthy variance

- **Granularity Gradient:** Inter-rater reliability correlates with scale granularity
  - Binary (2 levels): 3 unique values, r=0.10
  - Ternary (3 levels): 3-4 unique values, r=0.29
  - Likert (101 levels): 18-24 unique values, r=0.40

- **Evaluator Generosity:** All 5 evaluators showed generosity in discrete rubrics
  - Grok-3: 100% PASS (Binary)
  - GPT-4o: 99.4% PASS
  - Gemini: 98.3% PASS
  - DeepSeek: 96.9% PASS
  - Claude: 86.7% PASS (most discriminating)

**Decision Made:**
✅ Use **Likert (0-100 scale)** for Week 2-3 human validation

**Why This Matters:**
- Discovered boundary condition for when discrete rubrics fail
- Shows rubric design must match sample characteristics
- For frontier AI evaluation, continuous scales are necessary

**Files Created:**
- `analysis/rubric_comparison.py` (529 lines)
- `analysis/rubric_diagnostic.py` (338 lines)
- `notebooks/01_rubric_comparison.ipynb` (comprehensive)
- `results/experiments/exp_20251028_134615/analysis/rubric_comparison.json`
- `results/experiments/exp_20251028_134615/analysis/rubric_diagnostic.json`

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed data loading for Binary/Ternary (missing metadata)
- Fixed NaN handling in score variance calculations
- Added Ternary analysis throughout (was initially understated)
- Ensured all three rubrics covered in diagnostics

## Where We Left Off

**Completed:**
- ✅ Rubric comparison analysis complete and validated
- ✅ Likert rubric selected for human validation
- ✅ Methodology validated (ceiling effects confirmed)
- ✅ Notebook 1 complete with comprehensive diagnostics

**Next Session Should Start With:**
- Analysis 1.3: Evaluator Agreement Patterns (Notebook 2)
- Questions to answer:
  - Which evaluator pairs agree most/least?
  - Is Gemini still an outlier at n=360?
  - Does agreement vary by constitution/scenario/dimension?
  - Which trials have highest disagreement (validation candidates)?

**Estimated Time for Next Task:** 2-3 hours

## Key Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Rationale |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2025-10-31 | Use Likert (not Binary/Ternary) for validation | Best inter-rater reliability (r=0.40 vs 0.29 vs 0.10), maintains discrimination when samples are high-quality |
| 2025-10-31 | Frame unexpected result as "boundary condition discovery" | Shows when discrete rubrics fail (high-quality samples), demonstrates research maturity |
| 2025-10-31 | Include comprehensive diagnostics in Notebook 1 | Validates methodology, shows scientific rigor, anticipates reviewer questions |

## Portfolio Readiness

**Notebook 1 Status:** ✅ **PORTFOLIO READY**

- Comprehensive analysis with visualizations
- Validates surprising finding (shows research rigor)
- Transparent methodology (prompts included)
- Clear narrative arc (surprise → investigate → validate → conclude)
- Publication-quality figures and tables

**Can be shared immediately for job applications**

## Notes for Future Sessions

**Context to remember:**
- We expected Binary/Ternary to win (based on literature)
- Likert won instead - this is the interesting finding
- Ceiling effects are the root cause (validated)
- All three rubrics had comparable prompt quality
- Generosity is systematic across all evaluators

**Open questions for later analyses:**
- Is Gemini still an outlier in Likert scores? (Test in Analysis 1.3)
- Do certain constitutions cause more evaluator disagreement? (Analysis 1.3)
- Is there Model × Constitution interaction? (Analysis 1.2)
- Are the two dimensions (epistemic/transparency) independent? (Analysis 1.4)
